<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>PUNISHING ETHEL.</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Stop</span>, Ethel,” said Mary Gray authoritatively,
“stop this moment, you are skipping
notes.”</p>

<p>The child obeyed gladly, for music was by
no means a passion with her, and she especially
disliked practising when Mary’s sharp
eye was upon her.</p>

<p>“I’m obliged to be severe with you, Ethel,
for it never will do to allow you to play carelessly.
You are worse than usual this morning,
because Kittyleen is waiting in the
dining-room. It’s very unfortunate that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Kittyleen has to come here in your practising
hour, and it makes it pretty hard for
me; but what do you think or care about
that? If you ever learn to play decently,
Ethel Gray, ’twill be entirely owing to me,
and your teacher says so. There! run off
now and play with Kittyleen; but, remember,
you’ll have to finish your practising
this afternoon.”</p>

<p>Ethel made her escape, and Mary seated
herself in the bay-window at her sewing with
a deep sigh of responsibility. Her mother
was ill; Julia, the eldest of the family, was
confined to her room with headache, and the
children had been left in Mary’s care this
morning with strict charges to obey her.</p>

<p>“The children” were Philip, a boy of
eight and a half, and Ethel, a little girl
nearly six; but as Phil was now skating on
the pond, and Ethel playing dolls in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
dining-room with her young friend, Kittyleen
Garland, Mary was free to pursue her own
thoughts, and her work was soon lying idly
in her lap, while she looked out of the window
upon the white front yard facing the
river.</p>

<p>There was no one in the room with her
but her grandmother, who sat knitting in
an easy-chair before the glowing coal fire.
Grandma Gray did not seem to grow old.
Father Time had not stolen away a single
one of her precious graces. He had not
dimmed her bright eyes or jarred her gentle
voice; the wrinkles he had brought were
only “ripples,” and the gray hair he had
given her was like a beautiful silver crown.</p>

<p>Grandma looked up from her knitting;
Mary looked up from her sewing. Their
eyes met, and they both smiled.</p>

<p>“A penny for your thoughts, my child.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I was only thinking, grandma, it does
seem as if something might be done to prevent
people from calling me Flaxie Frizzle—I’m
just worn out with it. It did very well
when I was a little child; but now that I’m
twelve years old, I ought to be treated with
more respect. It’s very silly to call people
by anything but their real, true names;
don’t you think so? Oh, here comes the
Countess Leonora!” cried Mary in a different
tone, dropping her work, breaking her
needle, and pricking her finger, all in a second
of time.</p>

<p>“<i>Who?</i> I didn’t understand you, dear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s only Fanny Townsend, grandma.
We have fancy names for each other, we
girls, and Fanny’s name is Countess Leonora,”
cried Mary, quite unaware that there
was anything “silly” in this, or that grandma
was amused by her inconsistent remarks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
The dear old lady smiled benevolently as a
small figure in a brown cloak rushed in,
breathless from running. It was not Fanny
Townsend and Mary Gray, it seemed, who
began to chat together in the bay-window,
but the Countess Leonora, and her friend,
Lady Dandelina Tangle. Lady Dandelina
was telling the Countess that her mother
and sister were ill, and that she was left in
charge of the castle.</p>

<p>“Don’t you miss your brother Preston <i>so
much</i>, Lady Dandelina?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I do, Countess; but young men
are obliged to go to college, you know. And
I can bear it better because my cousin, Fred
Allen, of Hilltop, is with us. He will stay,
I don’t know how long, and go to school. I
only wish it was my sister Milly!”</p>

<p>“So do I, Lady Dandelina. Oh, I saw that
old teacher of ours, Mr. Fling, as I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
coming here. He stood on the hotel-piazza
talking with Miss Pike.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Fling?” said Mary, laughing. She
had dropped her work, for how could she
sew without a needle?</p>

<p>“Yes; and said he, ‘How’s your health,
Miss Fr-an-ce-s?’ as if I’d been sick. I like
him out of school, Dandelina; but in school
he used to be sort of hateful, don’t you
know?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly hateful,” replied Mary, stealing
a glance at grandma. “<i>I</i> call it troublesome.”</p>

<p>“Yes; how he would scold when we got
under the seat to eat apples?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I never ate but one apple, Fan, I’m
sure I never did. I was pretty small then,
too. How queer it is to think of such old
times!”</p>

<p>“Why, Flaxie, ’twas only last winter!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you sure, Fan? I thought ’twas
ever so long ago.”</p>

<p>“Your reminiscences are very interesting,
my dears,” said grandma, rising. “I wish I
could hear more, but I shall be obliged to go
up stairs now, and leave your pleasant company.”</p>

<p>As the serene old lady passed out at one
door, little Ethel, very much excited, rushed
in at another; but the girls, engrossed in
conversation, did not look up, and she stood
for some time unheeded behind Mary’s chair.</p>

<p>“I want to ask you, Flaxie—” she said.</p>

<p>“Mr. Fling and Miss Pike were talking
about a spelling-school,” said Fanny, emerging
from “old times” at a bound. “She’s
going to have an old-fashioned one out in her
school at Rosewood to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>“I want to ask you, Flaxie—” repeated
Ethel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“They ‘choose sides.’ Do you know what
that is?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m sure I don’t. I wish Preston
was here, and he’d take me out in the
sleigh. Miss Pike would let <i>our</i> family go,
of course.”</p>

<p>“I want to ask you—” said little Ethel
again.</p>

<p>“Why, Ethel, child, I thought you were
in the other room,” said Mary impatiently.
“Don’t you see, I want to hear about the
spelling-school; and it’s <i>so</i> thoughtful and
kind of little girls to give big girls a chance
to speak!”</p>

<p>But next moment, ashamed of her ill-nature,
and remembering her maternal responsibility,
she drew Ethel to her side and
kissed her.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Leonora, till we find out
what this means,” said she, surprised to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
her usually quiet little sister in this wild
state. “Tell me all about it, dear.”</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, Ethel broke forth indignantly,
“Kittyleen is very disagreeable!
And besides, she knocked me down!”</p>

<p>Fanny began to laugh. “Oh, what a Kittyleen!”</p>

<p>“Hush, Fan,” said Mary, warningly, drawing
up her mouth like grandma’s silk “work-pocket.”
“It doesn’t seem possible, Ethel.
I never heard of Kittyleen’s behaving
so before. What had you done to vex
her?”</p>

<p>“I—I—knocked her down—first,” confessed
Ethel, in low, faltering tones.</p>

<p>And Fanny laughed again.</p>

<p>“Fanny Townsend, do be quiet. I have
the care of this child to-day. Ethel, where
is Kittyleen?”</p>

<p>“Gone home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah. Ethel, Ethel, it will be my duty to
punish you. Fanny, <i>can</i> you be quiet?”</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> punish her? Oh dear, that’s too
funny!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have full authority to punish her
if I choose,” said Mary, elevating her chin.</p>

<p>She was subject to little attacks of dignity;
but instead of being duly impressed,
Fanny only laughed the more, while shamefaced
little Ethel hid her head and felt that
she was trifled with.</p>

<p>“May I ask what amuses you, Miss Townsend?”
said Mary, with increased dignity.</p>

<p>“Oh don’t, oh dear, what shall I do?
You’re so queer, Flaxie Frizzle!”</p>

<p>“Well, if you go on in this way, I shall be
obliged to take Ethel out of the room.
Have you no judgment <i>at all</i>, Fanny Townsend?”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, oh dear, I shall die laughing!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
shall have to go home! If you could see
just how you look, Flaxie Frizzle! <i>Good</i>-by.
I <i>can’t</i> help it,” said Fanny, reeling out of
the door.</p>

<p>Mary drew a long sigh. “Now come to
me, Ethel. This is a dreadful thing, and
you’re a perfectly awful child; but it will
not do to speak to mother about it, when she
has pneumonia, and a blister on the chest.
She said <i>I</i> must take care of you.”</p>

<p>Ethel did not stir. Mary paused and
gazed reproachfully across the room at her,
not knowing in the least what to say next.
She had never before undertaken a case of
discipline, and rather wondered why it
should be required of her now. But she had
been given “full authority over the children,”
and what did that mean if she was
not to punish them when they did wrong?</p>

<p>To be sure Julia’s headache might be over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
to-morrow, and Julia could then attend to
Ethel; but Mary was quite sure it would
not do to wait an hour or a minute; the
case must be attended to <i>now</i>. “It is my
duty, and I will not shrink from it. I’ll
try to act exactly as mamma always does,—not
harsh, but sad and gentle,—Ethel, my
child, come here.”</p>

<p>“Don’t want to,” said Ethel, approaching
slowly and sullenly, drawing her little chair
behind her.</p>

<p>“Not that way, dear; mamma never allows
you to go all doubled up, dragging your chair
like a snail with his house on his back.
There, sit down and tell me about it. What
made you so naughty?”</p>

<p>“My head aches. Don’t want to talk.”</p>

<p>“Were you playing dolls?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Pep’mint Drop is jiggly and won’t
sit up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“Peppermint Drop is very old and has
rheumatism, Ethel; she was my dolly before
ever you were born.”</p>

<p>“Well, my head aches. Don’t want to
talk.”</p>

<p>“But you must talk. I’m your mother
to-day.”</p>

<p>“<i>You?</i>” Ethel looked up saucily, and
Mary felt half inclined to laugh; but when
one has the care of a young child one must
be firm.</p>

<p>“Ethel, I <i>am</i> your mother to-day. What
were you doing with those dolls?”</p>

<p>“Nothing! Kittyleen pulled off Pep’mint’s
arm.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and then?”</p>

<p>“Then she was cross.”</p>

<p>“No, no. What did you do to her?”</p>

<p>“Tipped her over.”</p>

<p>“Ethel! Ethel!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, she tipped <i>me</i> over too.”</p>

<p>“This is perfectly dreadful!” exclaimed
Mary, as solemnly as if she had never heard
it before. And then she sat in deep thought.
What <i>would</i> mamma have done in this case?
<i>Did</i> Ethel’s head ache? Possibly. Her
cheeks looked hot. Mamma was tender of
the children when they were ill, and perhaps
would not approve of shutting Ethel in the
closet if she had taken cold.</p>

<p>“Ethel,” said Mary in natural tones, “I’m
going to be very sweet and gentle. You’ve
been extremely to blame, but perhaps Kittyleen
may forgive you if you ask her.”</p>

<p>“H’m! Don’t want her to!”</p>

<p>“What! Don’t want her to forgive you?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t; Kittyleen was bad <i>herself!</i>”</p>

<p>“But you were bad first, Ethel.”</p>

<p>“H’m! If I ask her to forgive me she’ll
think she was good!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary looked at stubborn Ethel sorrowfully.
Oh, how hard it was to make children repent!</p>

<p>“Perhaps I’d better leave her by herself
to think. Mamma does <i>that</i> sometimes.”
Then aloud: “Ethel, I’m now going into
the kitchen, and I wish you to sit here and
think till I come back.”</p>

<p>“No, you mustn’t; my mamma won’t
allow you to shut me up, Flaxie!”</p>

<p>“But I’m not shutting you up; I only
leave you to think.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know how to think.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you do, Ethel, you think every time
you wink.”</p>

<p>“Well, may I wink at the clock then?”
asked the child, relenting, for it was one of
her delights to sit and watch the minute-hand
steal slowly over the clock’s white face.</p>

<p>“Yes, you may, if you’ll keep saying over
and over, while it ticks, ‘I’ve been a naughty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
girl—a naughty girl; mamma’ll be sorry,
mamma’ll be sorry.’”</p>

</div>

<p>“Well, I will, but hurry, Flaxie; don’t be
gone long.”</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes Mary returned to find
the child in the same spot; her eyes pinker
than ever with weeping.</p>

<p>“Just the way I used to look when mamma
left <i>me</i> alone,” thought Mary, encouraged.</p>

<p>“Well, Ethel,” with a grown-up folding of
the hands which would have convulsed
Fanny Townsend. “Well, have you been
thinking, dear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I’ll tell mamma about it; I
shan’t tell you.”</p>

<p>“Mamma is very sick, my child.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll tell Ninny.” Ninny was the
children’s pet name for Julia.</p>

<p>“No, Ninny has a headache. I’m your
mamma this afternoon. And I won’t be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
cross to you, darling,” added Mary, with
humility, recalling some of her past lectures
to this little sister.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ethel faintly, with her apron
between her teeth. “I wasn’t <i>very</i> bad to
Kittyleen, but if she wants to forgive me
I’ll let her.”</p>

<p>“O sweetest, you make me so happy!”</p>

<p>“Don’t want to make <i>you</i> happy,” returned
Ethel disdainfully; “don’t care anything
about <i>you!</i> But mamma’s sick. And you—won’t
you write her a letter?”</p>

<p>“Write mamma a letter?”</p>

<p>“No, <i>Kittyleen</i>, write it with vi’let ink,
won’t you, Flaxie?”</p>

<p>The note was very short and written just
as Ethel dictated it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My Affectionate Friend</span>,—I am very sorry
I knocked you down first. I will forgive you if you
will forgive me.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Ethel Gray.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Ethel meant just this, no more, no less.
She was sorry; still, if she had done wrong
so had Kittyleen; if she needed forgiveness
Kittyleen needed it also.</p>

<p>“Now, put something in the corner,” said
she, looking on anxiously, as Mary directed
the envelope. “You always put something
in the corner of <i>your</i> notes, Flaxie; I’ve
seen you, and seen you.”</p>

<p>“Do I? Oh yes, sometimes I put ‘kindness
of Ethel’ in the corner, but that is
when <i>you</i> carry the note.”</p>

<p>“Put it there now.”</p>

<p>“But are you going to carry the note?”</p>

<p>“No, Dodo will carry it if I give her five
kisses.”</p>

<p>“Then, I’ll write ‘Kindness of Dora.’”</p>

<p>“No, no, I’m the one that’s kind, not
Dodo,” insisted the child.</p>

<p>And “Kindness of Ethel” it had to be in
the corner in large, plain letters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Dora laughed when she read it, and Mary
smiled indulgently.</p>

<p>Kittyleen did not smile, however, for she
did not know there was any mistake. She
accepted Ethel’s doubtful apology with joy,
and made her nurse Martha write in reply,
“I forgive you.” And in the left-hand
corner of <i>her</i> envelope were the words
“Kindness of Kittyleen,” for she supposed
that was the correct thing, and she never
allowed Ethel to be more fashionable than
herself if she could possibly help it.</p>

<p>Mary felt that on the whole her first case
of discipline had resulted successfully, and
was impatient for to-morrow to come, that
her mother might hear of it and give her
approval.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>ASKING FOR “WHIZ.”</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> day Mrs. Gray was somewhat better,
and when Mary knocked softly at the
chamber door, Julia replied, “Come in.”
The little girl had not expected to see her
mother looking so pale and ill; and the tears
sprang to her eyes as she leaned over the
bed to give the loving kiss which she meant
should fall as gently as a dewdrop on the
petal of a rose. It did not seem a fitting
time for the question she had come to ask
about the spelling-school. Julia was brushing
Mrs. Gray’s hair, and Mary kissed the
dark, silken locks which strayed over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
pillow, murmuring, “Oh, how soft, how beautiful!”</p>

<p>“Well, my dear,” said Mrs. Gray, with an
affectionate smile, which lacked a little of
its usual brightness, “how did you get on
yesterday with Ethel? She is such a quiet
little thing that I’m sure you had no
trouble.”</p>

<p>“No trouble!” Mary’s look spoke volumes.
“I suspect there’s some frightful
revelation coming now,” said Julia. “Did
you irritate her, Flaxie?” For Ethel’s quietness
was not always to be relied upon.
She was like the still Lake Camerino of
Italy, which so easily becomes muddy that
the Italians have a proverb, “Do not disturb
Camerino.” Dr. Gray often said to Mary,
when he saw her domineering over her little
sister, “Be careful! Do not disturb Camerino.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, indeed, Ninny, I was very patient,”
replied Mary with pride. “But for all that I
had to punish her!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray turned her head on her pillow,
and looked at Mary in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Did you think I gave you authority to
punish your little sister? That would have
been strange indeed! I merely said she and
Philip were to obey you during the afternoon.”</p>

<p>Mary felt a sudden sense of humiliation,
all the more as Julia had suspended the hairbrush,
and was looking down on her derisively—or
so she fancied.</p>

<p>“Why, mamma, I must have misunderstood
you. I thought it was the same as if I
was Julia, you know.”</p>

<p>“Julia is eighteen years old, my child.
You are twelve. But what had Ethel done
that was wrong?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Mary told of the quarrel with Kittyleen,
and the notes which had passed between
the two little girls. Though naturally
given to exaggeration, she had been so carefully
trained in this regard that her word
could usually be taken now without “a grain
of salt.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray looked relieved and amused.</p>

<p>“So that was the way you punished your
little sister? I was half afraid you had been
shutting her up in the closet, or possibly
snipping her fingers, either of which things,
my child, I should not allow.”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am.” Mary felt like a queen dethroned.</p>

<p>“You were ‘clothed with a little brief authority’
yesterday, to be sure, but you should
have waited till to-day and reported any misbehavior
to me, or—if I was too ill to hear
it—to Julia.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, mamma,” said Mary meekly.</p>

<p>“Not that I blame you for this mistake,
dear. You have shown judgment and self-control,
and no harm has been done as yet, I
hope. Only remember, if you are left to
take care of the children again, you are
not the one to punish them, whatever they
may do.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” repeated Mary; but her
face had brightened at the words “judgment
and self-control.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid Ethel’s repentance doesn’t
amount to much,” said Julia.</p>

<p>“I thought of that myself. I’m afraid it
doesn’t,” admitted Mary.</p>

<p>She watched the brush as it passed slowly
and evenly through her mother’s hair. Her
color came and went as if she were on the
point of saying something which after all
she found it hard to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mamma, Miss Pike is going to have—spelling-school
to-night.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray’s eyes were closed; she did not
appear to be listening.</p>

<p>“It’s in her schoolhouse at Rosewood,
and anybody can go that chooses.”</p>

<p>“Ah?”</p>

<p>“Papa isn’t at home this morning.” A
pause. “And Fred Allen and I—Now,
mamma, I’m afraid you’ll think it isn’t
<i>quite</i> best; but there’s a moon every night
now; and <i>did</i> you ever go to an old-fashioned
spelling-school, where they choose
sides?”</p>

<p>“Flaxie, don’t make that noise with the
comb,” said Julia. “I suppose you and Fred
would like the horse and sleigh, and Fred
hasn’t the courage to ask father; is that it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, may we go, mamma? Please may
we go?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“What, to Rosewood in the evening—two
miles?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish I hadn’t asked you. I wish
I hadn’t asked you; I mean I wish you
wouldn’t answer now, not till I tell you
something more.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will not answer at all; I leave it
to your father.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mean that; I don’t want you
to leave it to papa.”</p>

<p>“Flaxie,” remonstrated Julia, “can’t you
see that you are tiring mother?”</p>

<p>“I won’t tire her, Ninny. I only want her
to think a minute about Whiz, how old he is
and lame. He doesn’t frisk as he used to,
does he, mamma? And I’m sure Miss Pike
will want <i>me</i> at her spelling-school, we’re
such friends. And Fanny Townsend is
going, and lots and lots of girls of my
age.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“My dear, I leave it entirely to your
father,” said Mrs. Gray wearily.</p>

<p>“Yes, mamma; but if you’ll talk to him
first, and say Fred’s afraid to ask him, and—and
Whiz is so old——”</p>

<p>Julia frowned and pointed to the door.
Mary ought to have needed no second
warning. She might have seen for herself
the conversation was too fatiguing.</p>

<p>“What does make me so selfish and heedless
and forgetful and everything that’s
bad,” thought she, rushing down-stairs. “I
love my mother as well as Ninny does, and
am generally careful not to tire her; but if
I once forget they think I always forget, and
next thing papa will forbid my going into her
room.”</p>

<p>Fred stood by the bay window awaiting
his cousin’s report.</p>

<p>“O Fred, I don’t know yet; mamma isn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
well enough to be talked to, and we’ll have
to wait till papa comes home. <i>Perhaps</i> papa
won’t think you are too young to drive Whiz
just out to Rosewood. It isn’t like going
to Parnassus, ten miles; you know he didn’t
allow that.”</p>

<p>“Pretty well too if a fellow fourteen years
old can’t be trusted with that old rack-o-bones,”
said the youth scornfully, remembering
that Preston at his age had driven
Whiz; but then Preston and Fred were
different boys.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be the one to ask him,” said
Mary. “Shouldn’t you think the moon
would make a great difference? <i>I</i> should.”</p>

<p>It was while Dr. Gray was carving the
roast beef at dinner that Mary came out
desperately with the spelling-school question.
He seemed to be thinking of something else
at first, but when brought to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
what she meant, he said Miss Pike was a
sensible woman, and he approved of her,
and Mary and Fred “might go and spell
the whole school down if they could.”</p>

<p>This was beyond all expectation. Fred
looked gratified, and Mary, slipping from her
chair, sprang to her father and gave him a
sudden embrace, which interfered with his
carving and almost drove the knife through
the platter.</p>

<p>All the afternoon her mind was much
agitated. What dress should she wear? Did
Ninny think mother would object to the best
bonnet? And oh, she ought to be spelling
every moment! Wouldn’t grandma please
ask her all the hard words she could possibly
think of?</p>

<p>Grandma gave out a black list,—<i>eleemosynary</i>,
<i>phthisic</i>, <i>poniard</i>, and the like,—and
though Mary sometimes tripped, she did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
admirably well. Logomachy, anagrams, and
other spelling games were popular in the
Gray family, and all the children were good
spellers. Dr. Gray said, “They tell us that
silent letters are to be dropped out of our
language, and then the words will all look
as they sound; but this has not been done
yet, and meanwhile it is well to know how
to spell words as they are printed <i>now</i>.”</p>

<p>Julia was in her mother’s room, and Mary
was left again with the care of the children;
but in her present distraction she quite forgot
Ethel, and the child, left to her own
devices, managed to get the lamp-scissors
and cut off her hair. The zigzag notches,
bristling up in all directions, were a droll
sight.</p>

<p>“Oh, you little mischief,” cried Mary,
angry, yet unable to help laughing. “This
all comes of my reading you the story of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
‘Nine Little Goslings’ yesterday. Tell me,
was that what made you think of it?”</p>

<p>Ethel nodded her sheared head silently.</p>

<p>“Oh, you dreadful child. When I was trying
so hard to interest you! <i>I</i> didn’t want to
read to you! And to think you must go and
do this! What do people mean by calling
<i>you</i> good? I never cut off <i>my</i> hair, but nobody
ever called <i>me</i> good!”</p>

<p>Mary was seized again with laughter, but,
recovering, added sternly:—</p>

<p>“It’s very hard that I can’t shut you in
the closet, but you’ll get there fast enough!
Yes, I shall report you, and into the closet
you’ll go, Miss Snippet. Oh, you needn’t
cry; you’re the worst-looking creature in
town, but the blame always falls on <i>me!</i>
Just for those ‘Nine Little Goslings.’ And
here was I working so hard to get ready
for spelling-school and—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>The jingle of sleigh-bells put a sudden
stop to this eloquence. Ethel wiped her
eyes and stole to the window without speaking.
She was usually dumb under reproof,
and perhaps it was her very silence which
encouraged Mary to deliver “sermonettes,”
though I fear these sermonettes hardened
instead of softening little Ethel’s heart.
The young preacher was smiling enough,
however, when she went out to enter the
sleigh; and Julia, who tucked her in, looked
as if she were trying her best not to be
proud of her bright young sister. Mary
felt very well pleased with herself in her
new cloak and beaver hat, with its jaunty
feather; but she was not quite satisfied with
cousin Fred.</p>

<p>“He can’t drive half as well as Preston;
and, worse than that, he doesn’t know how
to spell,” thought she, as they drove on in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
time to the merry music of the bells. They
had gone about half a mile, and Fred had
used the whip several times with a lordly
flourish, always to the great displeasure of
Whiz, when they were suddenly brought to a
pause by a loud voice calling out,—</p>

<p>“Stop! Hilloa, boy, stop!”</p>

<p>To say that they were both very much
frightened would be no more than the truth.
Mary’s first thought was the foolish one, “Oh,
can it be a highway robber?” while Fred
wondered if anything was amiss with the
harness. It might be wrong side upward for
aught he knew.</p>

<p>But they were both alarmed without cause.
As soon as Fred could rein in his angry
steed, it appeared that the owner of the
voice was only Mary’s old friend and former
teacher, Mr. Harrison Fling, and all he
wished to say was,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, Miss Mary and Master Fred, are
you going to spelling-school?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Fred, touching his cap;
while Mary hoped nothing had happened to
the spelling-school to prevent their going.</p>

<p>“And may I ride with you?” asked the
young man, with a persuasive bow and smile.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, if you like,” replied Fred, rather
relieved to find it was no worse, though certainly
not pleased.</p>

<p>“I’ll drive, of course,” said Mr. Fling
serenely, seating himself, and taking Mary in
his lap. “Master Fred, your aunt will thank
me for happening along just as I did, for
you were going at breakneck speed. You
would have been spilled out at the next
corner.”</p>

<p>Fred’s brows were knitted fiercely under
his cap. Was it possible that Mr. Fling was
regarded as a gentleman?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“Miss Flaxie,” pursued the interloper, “I
hope you’re as glad to see me again as I am
to see you. Don’t you feel safer now I’ve
taken the reins?”</p>

<p>Mary did not know what reply to make.
She was not glad to see him, yet she did feel
safer to have him drive. She laughed a
little, and the laugh grated unpleasantly on
Fred’s ears. This was the first time he had
ever taken his young cousin to ride, and he
thought it would be the last.</p>

<p>Mr. Fling talked all the way to Miss
Pike’s school-house, apparently not minding
in the least that nobody answered him.
“Now, children,” said he, lifting Mary out,
and planting her upon the door-stone before
Fred could offer his hand, “now, children,
with your permission, I’ll drive a little farther.
I’d like to drop in on a few of my
old friends in this neighborhood. Give my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
very best regards to Miss Pike, and tell her
I hope to be back in season to hear a little
of the spelling.”</p>

<p>“With your permission,” indeed! Fred
was incensed. If Mr. Fling had been a person
of his own age, he would have said to
him, and very properly, too, “I have no right
to lend Dr. Gray’s horse, and you have no
right to ask me for him.” But as Mr. Fling
was at least a dozen years older than himself,
such a speech would have been impertinent;
and Fred could only look as forbidding as
possible, and preserve a total silence, while
Mr. Fling caught up the reins again, and
was off and away without further ceremony.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he a funny man?” said Mary.
“Funny” was not the word Fred would have
used.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>THE SPELLING-SCHOOL.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> spelling-school had not yet begun, but
Fanny Townsend and her brother Jack had
already arrived, and so had Mr. Garland,
and his nephew, Mr. Porter. Miss Pike
expressed pleasure at seeing them all, and
stood at the desk some time with her arm
around Mary’s waist, chatting about “old
times” at Laurel Grove, at Hilltop, and at
Washington. Mary was feeling of late that
there were many old times in her life, and
that she had lived a long while. She had
been quite a traveller, had seen and known a
variety of people, but nobody—outside her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
own family—that is, no grown person,—was
so dear to her as this excellent young lady,
who was known among strangers as “the
homely Miss Pike.” Mary had attended her
school at Hilltop with Milly Allen, and afterward
Miss Pike had been a governess in Dr.
Gray’s family, and still later had spent a
winter with the Grays at Washington. She
had a decided fancy for Mary; and in return
the little girl always called Miss Pike her
“favorite friend.” It is only to be wished
that every little girl had just such a “favorite
friend.”</p>

<p>But it was now time for the exercises to
begin. At a tap of the bell everybody was
seated. The scholars were nearly all older
than Mary, she and Fanny being perhaps the
youngest ones there.</p>

<p>“This is an old-fashioned spelling-match,”
explained Miss Pike to her visitors, “and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
will now announce the names of the two
‘captains,’ Grace Mallon and James Hunnicut.
They will take their places.”</p>

<p>Upon this James Hunnicut, a large, intelligent-looking
boy of fifteen, walked to one
side of the room and stood against the wall,
and Grace Mallon, a sensible young girl of
fourteen, walked to the other side of the
room, and took her place exactly opposite
James. They both looked very earnest and
alive.</p>

<p>Grace had the first choice; next James;
and so on for some minutes. There was
breathless interest in it, for, as the best
spellers would naturally be chosen first, the
whole school sat waiting and hoping. The
house was so still that one heard scarcely a
sound except the names spoken by the two
captains, and the brisk footsteps of the
youths and maidens crossing the room, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
they were called, now to Grace’s side, now to
James’s, there to stand like two rows of soldiers
on drill.</p>

<p>Miss Pike could not but observe the
sparkle of satisfaction in some faces, and the
gloom of disappointment in others; and she
rejoiced with the good spellers and grieved
with the poor ones, like the dear, kind
woman she was.</p>

<p>Out of courtesy, Mary Gray and Fanny
Townsend were chosen among the first.
James Hunnicut supposed it would be ungallant
to neglect visitors, though he did wince
a little as he called Mary Gray’s name,
thinking, “What do I want of a baby like
that? Of course she’ll miss every word.”</p>

<p>Mary answered James’s call with a throbbing
heart, proud, delighted, yet afraid.
Next Grace Mallon called Fred Allen, and
thought, when he walked over to her side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
with his well-bred air, that she had secured a
prize. How could she suspect that a distinguished-looking
lad like that was not a “natural
speller,” and did not always do as well
as he knew, on account of his habit of speaking
before he thought? In fact, he missed
the very first word, <i>exactly</i>, making the first
syllable <i>eggs</i> in his ruinous haste. Of course
he knew better, but no allowance was made
for mistakes, and like a flash the word was
passed across the room to Mary, who spelled
it correctly.</p>

<p>Fred felt disgraced, lost all confidence,
and, if he had dared, would have asked to be
excused from duty. Captain Grace would
have excused him gladly, but such a thing
was never heard of; he must stand at his
post, and blunder all the evening.</p>

<p>It was the custom, when a word was
missed on one side and corrected on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
other, for the successful captain to swell his
own numbers by “choosing off” one from
the enemy’s ranks. Captain James now
“chose off” one of Captain Grace’s best
soldiers, and the game went on.</p>

<p>Next time it was one of Captain James’s
men—Fanny Townsend—who blundered,
and it was Captain Grace’s turn to choose
off.</p>

<p>For some time the numbers were about
even; but as Fred Allen invariably missed,
and there were Jack Townsend and other
poor spellers below him to keep him company,
Captain James began to have a decided
advantage. He kept choosing off again and
again,—Mary Gray, among the rest,—while
Captain Grace bit her lips in silence.</p>

<p>But the moment she had it in her power
she called a name in a ringing voice, and it
was “Mary Gray.” Mary had spelled all her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
words promptly,—they had usually been hard
ones, too,—and her blue eyes danced as she
tripped across the room in answer to the
call. Was there a ray of triumph in her
glance as it fell on cousin Fred, who was
propping his head against the wall, trying to
look easy and unconcerned? Fred, who was
so much older than herself, and ciphering at
the very end of the arithmetic? Fred, who
had always looked down on little Flaxie as
rather light-minded?</p>

<p>There he stood, and there he was likely to
stand, and Jack Townsend, too, while the
favorite spellers with ill-concealed satisfaction
were walking back and forth conquering
and to conquer.</p>

<p>Mary Gray was called for as often as the
oldest scholar in the room, and, as she flitted
from east to west, her head grew as light
with vanity as the “blowball” of a dandelion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
She threw it back airily, and smiled in
a superior way when poor Fred missed a
word, as if she would like to say to the
scholars, “I came here with that dunce, it’s
true, but please don’t blame <i>me</i> because he
can’t spell.”</p>

<p>“That’s a remarkably bright, pretty little
girl, but I fancy she wouldn’t toss her head
so if there was much in it,” whispered Mr.
Garland’s nephew to Miss Pike, while Mr.
Garland was putting out the words.</p>

<p>Miss Pike had been pained by Mary’s
silly behavior, but replied:—</p>

<p>“You are wrong, quite wrong, Mr. Porter,
she is a dear little girl and has plenty of
sense.”</p>

<p>It was positively gratifying to the good
lady afterwards to hear Mary mis-spell the
word <i>pillory</i>, for the mortification humbled
her, and from that moment there was no
more tossing of curls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>When the time was up, Captain James’s
side had conquered most victoriously, numbering
twice as many as the other side.
The two captains bowed to each other and
the game was over. Then Fred Allen,
Fanny Townsend, and all the other wallflowers
were allowed at last to move. It
was time to go home.</p>

<p>The girls and boys, all shawled and hooded
and coated and capped, went toward the
door, chatting and laughing.</p>

<p>James Hunnicut said to Grace Mallon,
“Beg your pardon; I didn’t mean to take
<i>all</i> your men.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” returned Grace, undaunted, “I had
men enough left, and dare say I should
have got every one of yours away from
you if we’d only played half an hour
longer.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you would, would you? Well, we’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
try it again and see. Isn’t that little girl
of Dr. Gray’s a daisy?”</p>

<p>“Not quite equal to the Allen boy; I
admire <i>him</i>,” returned Grace in an undertone;
but Fred heard and buttoned his overcoat
above a swelling heart.</p>

<p>“Good night, we’re all so glad you came,”
said Miss Pike, shaking hands warmly with
him and Mary. Then off she went, and half
the school followed, walking and riding by
twos and threes and fours.</p>

<p>But where, oh where, in the name of all the
spelling-schools, was Fred’s horse? There
wasn’t the shadow of him to be seen.
Where was Fred’s sleigh? There was
not so much as the tip of a runner in
sight. Where was Mr. Fling? Gone to
Canada, perhaps, the smooth-faced deceitful
wretch!</p>

<p>Fred would “have a sheriff after him,” so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
he assured cousin Flaxie, and that immediately.</p>

<p>Mary stamped her little low-heeled boots
to keep her feet warm, and highly approved
of the plan.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, Fred, do call a sheriff; I’m perfectly
willing;” and the situation seemed delightfully
tragic, till somebody laughed, and
then it occurred to her that sheriffs, whatever
they may be, do not grow on bushes or in
snow-banks. And, of course, Mr. Fling had
not gone to Canada, Fred knew that well
enough; he had only “dropped in” at somebody’s
house and forgotten to come out.</p>

<p>“The people, wherever he is, ought to
send him home,” said James Hunnicut sympathetically.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” assented two or three others.
“It’s abominable to go ’round calling with a
borrowed horse and sleigh.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>So much pity was galling to both Mary
and Fred, making them feel like young
children, who ought not to have been
trusted without a driver. Why wouldn’t
everybody go away and leave them. The
situation would surely be less embarrassing
if they faced it alone.</p>

<p>Fred was angry and undignified. He had
had as much as he could bear all the evening,
and this was a straw too much. Mary, on
the other hand, had enjoyed an unusual
triumph; but how her feet did ache with
cold! The blood had left them hours ago
to light a blazing fire in her head; and
now to stand on that icy door-stone was
torture!</p>

<p>“I know I shall freeze, but I’ll bear it,”
thought she, taking gay little waltzing steps.
“How they do admire me, and it would spoil
it all to cry. Why, all the great spelling I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
could do in a year wouldn’t make up for one
cry.”</p>

<p>Just as she had got as far as to remember
that she had heard of a man whose feet
“froze and fell off,” Grace Mallon asked
when her brother Phil would have a vacation?
She had shut her teeth together
firmly, but being obliged to answer this
question, her voice, to her dire surprise and
confusion, came forth in a sob! Not one
articulate word could she speak; and there
was Captain James Hunnicut looking straight
at her! Keener mortification the poor child
had seldom known. Following so closely,
too, upon her evening’s triumph! But at
that moment Mr. Garland, who was about
driving off with his nephew, stopped his horse
and said: “This is too bad! Here, Miss
Flaxie, here’s a chance for you to ride with
us. We can make room for her, can’t we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Stephen? But as for you, Master Fred, I
see no other way but you must wait for your
horse.”</p>

<p>Mary, utterly humbled, sprang with gratitude
into Mr. Garland’s sleigh, without
trusting herself to look back.</p>

<p>And Fred did “wait,” with a heart swelling
as big as a foot-ball, and saw his cousin
bestowed between the two gentlemen, who
smiled on him patronizingly, as upon a boy
of four in pinafores.</p>

<p>This was hard. And when Mr. Fling
appeared at last, laughing heartlessly, and
drove the half-frozen boy part of the way
home, leaving him at the hotel, the most
convenient point for himself, and advising
him to take ginger-tea and go to bed,—this
oh, this, was harder yet!</p>

<p>But it was Mrs. Gray who suffered most
from this little <i>fiasco</i>. Before the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
returned she was flushed and nervous, and
Dr. Gray blamed himself for having allowed
them to go.</p>

<p>“I’m thankful, my daughter, that you’ve
got here alive,” said she, sending for Mary to
come to her chamber; “Whiz is a fiery
fellow, and Fred isn’t a good driver.”</p>

<p>“Was it as delightful as you expected,
Mary? And did you spell them all down?”
asked her father.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, it was delightful; and I spelled
ever so many hard words, and only missed
one; but Fred spells shockingly,” replied
Mary, taking up a vial from the stand and
putting it down again.</p>

<p>“So, on the whole, I see you didn’t quite
enjoy it,” said Mrs. Gray, rather puzzled by
Flaxie’s disconsolate look.</p>

<p>“Not quite, mamma; don’t you think Mr.
Fling was very impolite? And oh, I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
warm my feet, they are nearly frozen,” said
Mary, questioning within herself why it was
that, whenever she had a signal triumph,
something was almost sure to happen that
“spoiled it all.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>THE MINISTER’S JOKE.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> spelling-school, with its triumphs and
chagrins, had partially faded from Mary’s
memory, to become one of her “old times;”
for winter had gone, and it was now the
very last evening of March.</p>

<p>You may not care to hear how the wind
blew, and really it has nothing to do with
our story, only it happened to be blowing
violently. Tea was over, and everybody had
left the dining-room but Mary and cousin
Fred. Mary had just parted the curtains
to look out, as people always do on a windy
night, when Fred startled her by saying, in a
whisper, “Flaxie, come here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>She dropped the curtain hastily, and
crossed the room. What could Fred be
wanting of her, and why should he whisper
when they two were alone, and the wind
outside was making such a noise?</p>

<p>“Put your ear down close to my mouth,
Flaxie. You mustn’t tell anybody, now
remember.”</p>

<p>“Why not, Fred? It isn’t best to make
promises beforehand. Perhaps I ought to
tell.”</p>

<p>“Ought to tell? I like that! Then I’ll
keep it to myself, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Now, Fred, I didn’t say I <i>would</i> tell.
And, if it’s something perfectly right and
proper, I won’t tell, of course.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s right and proper enough. Do
you promise? Yes or no?”</p>

<p>“<i>Yes</i>, then,” said Flaxie, too anxious for
Fred’s confidence, and too much honored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
by it to refuse, though she knew from past
experience that he frequently held peculiar
views as to “propriety.”</p>

<p>“Here, see this,” said he, taking a smooth
block of wood from his pocket and whispering
a word of explanation. “Won’t it be
larks?”</p>

<p>She drew back with a nervous laugh.
“Why, Fred!”</p>

<p>“And I didn’t know but you’d like to
go with me, Flaxie, just for company.”</p>

<p>“But do you think it’s exactly proper?
He’s a minister, you know.”</p>

<p>“Why that’s the very fun of it,—just
because he <i>is</i> a minister! It’s the biggest
thing that’ll be done to-morrow, see if it
isn’t?”</p>

<p>Mary looked doubtful.</p>

<p>“I was a goose to tell <i>you</i>, though, Flaxie;
I might have known girls always make a
fuss.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t because I’m a girl, Fred!
Girls like fun as well as anybody, only girls
have more——.” She did not know whether
to say “delicacy” or “discretion,” but decided
that either word would give offence;
“girls are different.”</p>

<p>“Then you won’t go with me? No matter.
I believe, after all, I’d rather have one
of the boys.”</p>

<p>“Yes, oh yes, I will go with you; I’d
like to go,” exclaimed Mary, desperately,
throwing discretion to the winds.</p>

<p>“Agreed, then,—to-morrow morning on
the way to school. And now mind, Flaxie,
don’t put this down in your journal to-night,
for that would let it all out.”</p>

<p>“Why, nobody ever looks at my journal!
It would be dishonest.—Why, Fred,” in
sudden alarm, “did <i>you</i> ever look at my
journal?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“Poh! what do I care for your old scribblings?”
The boy’s manners had been
falling to decay all winter for lack of his
mother’s constant “line upon line.” “Only
your journal is always ’round, and you’d
better be careful, that’s all.”</p>

<p>Next morning it rained, and Mary walked
to school with Fred under the gloom of a
big umbrella, Phil having been sent on in
advance.</p>

<p>“Pretty weather for April Fools,” remarked
Fred, carefully guarding under his
arm a neat little package containing a block
of wood, with a card, on which were the
words, simple but significant, “April Fool.”</p>

<p>Arriving at Rev. Mr. Lee’s door-yard, he
walked up the narrow gravel-path with Flaxie
beside him, “just for company.”</p>

<p>“Now don’t laugh and spoil it,” said he.
And, to solemnize his own face, he tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
think of the horrible time last summer, when
he and his brother John went for pond-lilies,
and were upset and nearly drowned. Mary
looked as if she were thinking of an accident
still worse, her face drawn to remarkable
length, and her mouth dolefully puckered.</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose Mr. Lee will come
himself, do you?” whispered Fred, ringing
the door-bell very gently.</p>

<p>“Oh Fred, let’s go away. Just think if
he should put you in a sermon? He put
somebody in once for stealing watermelons.
He didn’t say the name right out, but——”</p>

<p>Two early dandelions by the front window
seemed bubbling over with merriment and
curiosity; but before they or Fred had
learned who stole the watermelons, Fred
stopped his cousin by saying contemptuously,
“When a man gets nicely fooled
he won’t put <i>that</i> in a sermon, you’d better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
believe.” And then, gathering courage, he
rang louder.</p>

<p>Mary was deliberating whether to run or
not, when the housemaid appeared.</p>

<p>“Will you give this to Mr. Lee? Very
important,” said Fred, handing her the dainty
little parcel.</p>

<p>She looked at it, she seemed to look
through it; a merry glint came into her
eyes.</p>

<p>“I was afraid somebody was dead,” said
she. “You rung so loud, and you looked so
terrible solemn, both of you.”</p>

<p>“Solemn?” echoed Fred; and then it
was he, not Mary, who broke down and
smiled.</p>

<p>“Mr. Lee’s gone to a <i>funeril</i>,” continued
Hannah, looking through and through the
parcel again; “but I’ll give it to him when
he comes home, and tell him who brought it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Did Fred wish her to tell him? He began
to doubt it.</p>

<p>“Come, Flaxie, we must go.”</p>

<p>“Fred,” said the little girl, as they hurried
out of the gate, “I can’t help thinking;
shan’t we feel sorry next Sunday?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” returned her cousin. He
had already thought about Sunday, and fancied
himself looking up to the pulpit to meet
Mr. Lee’s eye. Had he been quite respectful
to that learned and excellent man?</p>

<p>“Nonsense! ministers are no better than
other folks!”</p>

<p>It was too late to repent; but he wished
now he had waited till afternoon and thought
of all the possible consequences. <i>Perhaps</i>
the fun wouldn’t pay. These doubts, however,
he did not mention to the boys at
school, but told them he had made “a
splendid fool” of the minister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>That evening, as he and Mary stood by the
carriage-way gate, and he was opening it for
Dr. Gray to drive into the yard, who should
be passing on the other side of the street,
but Mr. Lee.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Dr. Gray,” said he;
and came over to do a trivial errand, which
Fred fancied must have been made up for
the occasion; it was something about a book
which he wished to borrow some time, not
now. Then, turning to guilty Fred, who had
not dared slip away,—</p>

<p>“Good evening, Master Fred,” with extreme
politeness; “I was very sorry not to
be at home this morning when you left your
card.”</p>

<p><i>Your</i> card! Those were his words.</p>

<p>“<i>My</i> card! Does he think I signed <i>myself</i>
April Fool? My goodness, so I did!
People always put their own names on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
visiting-cards, sure enough! It’s I that am
the April Fool, and nobody else,” thought
the outwitted boy, not venturing to look up.</p>

<p>A blush mounted to Mary’s forehead, and
she too looked at the ground.</p>

<p>“Pray call again, Master Fred,” said Mr.
Lee; and his manner was as respectful as if
Fred had been at least a supreme judge.</p>

<p>“What’s all this?” asked the doctor
sternly as the clergyman walked away.</p>

<p>“’Twas a little kind of a—a joke, you
know, sir, for fun. I didn’t mean anything.
I like Mr Lee first rate,” stammered Fred,
scanning his boots, as if to decide whether
they were big enough for him to crawl into
and hide.</p>

<p>Dr. Gray never needed to be told more
than half a story.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see! You’ve made an April Fool
of yourself. Ha, ha! Mr. Lee is too sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
for you, is he? And so, Mary, you went
with Fred?”</p>

<p>The doctor looked grave. It was not easy
to let this pass. “Wait here, both of you,
till I come back,” said he, driving into the
stable.</p>

<p>“This is a great go,” thought Fred.
“Hope the boys won’t hear of it.”</p>

<p>“Fred,” said Dr. Gray, returning,—and
he spoke with displeasure,—“I am disappointed
in you. And in you too, Mary.”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa,” wailed a little voice from
under Mary’s hat. Her head was bowed,
and her tears were falling.</p>

<p>“I was the one that thought of it; I was
the one that asked her to go,” spoke up
Fred, all the manliness in him stirred by his
cousin’s tears.</p>

<p>“No doubt you were; and I’m glad to
hear you acknowledge it,” said Dr. Gray,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
resting his hand on his nephew’s shoulder.
“But Mary knew better than to be led away
by you. My daughter, jests of this sort may
be tolerated in your own family or among
your schoolmates; but do you think they
are suitable to be played upon ministers?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” sobbed Mary.</p>

<p>“Well, then, let this be a lesson to you.”
This was a favorite speech with the doctor.
“Kiss me, my child; and now run into the
house. I shall never refer to this matter
again, and it is not necessary to mention it
to your mother. But Fred,” he added, as
Mary swiftly escaped, “do you think your
conduct has been gentlemanly and courteous?
Ought you to have taken this liberty with a
comparative stranger,—a person, too, of
Mr. Lee’s high character?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do you think your mother would be
pleased to hear of it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know she wouldn’t,” admitted Fred
frankly.</p>

<p>Dr. Gray’s countenance softened.</p>

<p>“I don’t like to be harsh with you, for you
meant no impertinence; still, if I am to treat
you as my own child, as your parents desire,
I believe I shall have to bid you ask Mr.
Lee’s pardon. What say you to that? It’s
the way I should treat Preston.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Fred sadly.</p>

<p>Next morning saw the lad, cap in hand,
knocking at the door of the minister’s study.
Mary had half-offered to go with him, but he
had scorned to accept the sacrifice.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said Mr. Lee, opening the door.</p>

<p>Fred advanced one step into the room.
There was an awful pause, during which
those very dandelions of yesterday winked
at him from a silver vase, and his well-pondered
speech began to grow hazy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“My uncle sent me to apologize,” he faltered
forth. “I didn’t mean to be disrespectful
to a—to a minister. For I think—of
course I think—that ministers——”</p>

<p>Here a certain twinkle in Mr. Lee’s eye
distracted Fred, and his speech flew right
out of the window. “For I <i>don’t</i> think,”
added he, in wild haste, “that ministers are
any better than other folks.”</p>

<p>It was just like Fred. He had meant to
say something entirely opposite to this; but
the “imp of the perverse” was apt to seize
his tongue. Oh, dear, he had finished the
business now!</p>

<p>“I agree with you, my boy; ministers
aren’t any better than other folks, certainly,”
said Mr. Lee, laughing outright in the most
genial way.</p>

<p>“Oh, that wasn’t what I meant, sir.
Please don’t think I meant to say that,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
pleaded Fred, feeling himself more than ever
the most foolish of April fools.</p>

<p>But the good-natured clergyman drew him
into the room. “Come, now,” said he, still
laughing, though not sarcastically at all, just
merrily, “let me have the call I missed yesterday.
Your cousin Preston is one of my
best friends, but I think you’ve never entered
my study before.”</p>

<p>It was a cosy, sunny room, and, beside
books, held a large cabinet, and a green
plant-stand, blooming with flowers. Fred
seated himself on the edge of a chair, ready
for instant departure; but Mr. Lee chatted
most agreeably, telling interesting stories,
and inquiring about Hilltop people, till he
forgot his embarrassment, and was soon
asking questions in regard to the different
objects in the cabinet.</p>

<p>What was that whitish, buff-colored stuff?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
<i>Coquina?</i> Oh! And people built houses
of it? Possible? Was it really made of
shells? How strange!—Well, that tarantula’s
nest was a queer concern! Why, it
shut down like a trap-door exactly. Looked
as if it had a hinge, and a carpenter made it.—Was
that an eagle’s claw?—Oh, and <i>that?</i>
A rattlesnake’s rattle?—Was this a scorpion?—And
so on.</p>

<p>It was a varied collection, and Mr. Lee
seemed to have nothing to do that morning
but to exhibit it. Not another word about
the April Fool; but Fred felt that he was
forgiven, or, rather, that no forgiveness was
needed, as no offence had been taken.</p>

<p>“I tell you, Flaxie,” confided he to his
cousin afterward, “I never liked Mr. Lee half
so well; never dreamed he was so bright and
sharp. <i>He</i> likes fun as well as we boys.
Only somehow—Well, I wouldn’t do it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
again; it was foolish. See here, Flaxie, have
you put this in your journal? Well, don’t
you now! If the boys should find out—”</p>

<p>“What do you mean about my journal?”
returned Mary, drawing up her mouth like
the silk “work-pocket,” to mark her displeasure.
“Anybody’d think my journal
was a newspaper.”</p>

<p>Fred smiled wisely.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>CHINESE BABIES.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> journal was a pretty little red book,
which lay sometimes on the piano, sometimes
on the centre-table, and was often
opened innocently enough by callers. If it
had been the simple, matter-of-fact little
book that it ought to have been, the reading
of it would have done no harm. But Mary
had a habit of recording her emotions, also
her opinions of her friends,—a bad habit,
which she did not break off till it had nearly
brought her into trouble.</p>

<p>“What does Fred Allen mean by calling
me ‘Miss Fanny dear, with mouth stretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
from ear to ear’?” asked Fanny Townsend,
indignantly.</p>

<p>“How do you know he did?”</p>

<p>“Saw it in your journal. And you put a
period after ‘Miss’! Needn’t accuse me of
laughing, Flaxie Frizzle, when I happen to
know that my mother considers <i>you</i> a great
giggler, and dreads to have you come to our
house.”</p>

<p>“Does she? Then I’ll stay away! And
if I did put a period after ‘Miss’ it was a
mistake. But I’ve no respect for people
that read other people’s private journals!”</p>

<p>“Hope you don’t call that private. Why,
I thought ’twas a Sabbath-school book, or I
wouldn’t have touched it.” And whether
she would or not, Fanny was obliged to
laugh; so the breach was healed for the
time. But after this Mary began a new
journal, which she conducted on different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
principles, trying moreover to keep it in its
proper place in her writing-desk.</p>

<p>There were secret signs and mysterious
allusions in this new journal, however, the
letters “C. C.” recurring again and again in
all sorts of places, without any apparent
meaning or connection. She evidently enjoyed
scribbling them, and no harm was
done, since nobody but “we girls” knew
what they meant. “C. C.” was a precious
secret, which we may pry into for ourselves
by-and-by.</p>

<p>Mary was now in her thirteenth year, and
though she still enjoyed hanging May-baskets,
driving hoops, skipping the rope, and
even playing dolls, her growing mind was
never idle. She enjoyed her lessons at
school, for she memorized with ease; she
liked to draw; but sitting at the piano was a
weariness; and she considered it a trial that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
in addition to her own practising, she
should be expected to teach and superintend
Ethel. She was strict with her little pupil,
and found frequent occasion for sermonettes,
but Ethel got on famously, and Mary received
and deserved high praise as teacher.</p>

<p>She missed her cousin Fred when he went
home at last, not to return, but she told
Lady Fotheringay (Blanche Jones) in confidence
that she “could improve her mind
better when he was gone.” Moreover, Preston
would soon be home for his summer
vacation.</p>

<p>She was beginning to question what she
was made for. Something grand and wonderful,
no doubt; something much better
than studying, reading, sewing, and doing
errands. There were times when this favored
child of fortune even said to herself
that life was hard, and that her mother was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
over-strict in requiring her to mend her
clothes and do a stint of some sort of sewing
on Saturdays. Wasn’t she old enough yet
to have outgrown stints?</p>

<p>“Why can’t pillow-cases be hemmed by
machine?” complained she to Ethel. “And
there <i>you</i> are,—almost six years old, with not
a thing to do! I can tell you I used to sew
patchwork at your age by the yard! C. C.
I keep saying that over to comfort myself,
Ethel, but <i>you</i> don’t know what it stands for.
Oh no, <i>not</i> chocolate candy; better than
that!—Wish I lived at the south, where
colored servants do everything. There’s
Grandma Hyde now; if we had her black
Venus, and her black Mary, and her yellow
Thomas, I shouldn’t have to dust parlors and
run of errands! Mamma is always talking
to me about being useful. <i>Little</i> girls are
never talked to in that way; it’s we older<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
girls who have to bear all the brunt. It
tires me to death to sew, sew, sew! Now
it’s such fun to run in the woods. Mr. Lee
says we ought to admire nature, and I’m
going after flag-root this afternoon instead of
mending my stockings—I think it’s my
duty!”</p>

<p>As Mary rattled on in this way, little
Ethel listened most attentively. Her sister
Flaxie stood as a pattern to her of all the
virtues,—ah, if Flaxie had but known it!—and
she looked forward to the time when she
should be exactly like her, with just such
curls, and just that superior way of lecturing
little people. It was not worth while to be
any better than Flaxie. If Flaxie objected
to sewing and mending, Ethel would object
to it also.</p>

<p>“If my mamma ever makes me sit on a
chair to sew patchwork, I’ll go South! If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
she makes me mend stockings, I’ll go in the
woods! I won’t be useful if Flaxie isn’t;
no indeedy!”</p>

<p>Thus while Flaxie’s sermonettes were forgotten,
her chance words and her example
took deep hold of the little one’s mind.</p>

<p>Everybody said Mary was growing up a
sweet girl, more “lovesome” and womanly
than had once been expected. In truth
Mary thought so herself. Plenty of well-meaning
but injudicious people had told her
she was pretty; and she knew that Mrs. Lee
liked to look at her face because it was so
“expressive,” and Mrs. Patten because it was
so “thoughtful,” and somebody else because
it was so “intelligent.” Ethel had a figure
like a roly-poly pudding; but Mary was tall
and slight, and even Mrs. Prim admitted that
she was “graceful.”</p>

<p>One Sunday morning early in May she sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
in church, apparently paying strict attention
to the sermon, but really thinking.</p>

<p>“I dare say, now, Mrs. Townsend is looking
at me, and wishing Fanny were more
like me. Nobody else of my age sits as still
as I do, except Sadie Stockwell, and she has
a stiff spine. There’s Major Patten, I remember
he said once to father, ‘Dr. Gray,
your second girl is a child to be proud of.’ I
know he did, for I was coming into the room
and heard him.”</p>

<p>Directly after morning services came Sunday
school, and Mary was in Mrs. Lee’s
class. Mrs. Lee was an enthusiastic young
woman, fond of all her scholars, but it was
easy to see that Mary was her prime favorite.
Mrs. Gray’s class of boys—Phil being the
youngest—sat in the next seat. The lesson
to-day was short, and after recitation Mrs.
Lee showed her own class and Mrs. Gray’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
some pictures which her uncle had brought
her from China.</p>

<p>“What <i>is</i> that queer thing?” said Fanny,
as she and Mary touched bonnets over one of
the pictures.</p>

<p>“That is called a baby-tower. My uncle
says it is a good representation of the dreadful
place they drop girl-babies into sometimes.
You know girls are lightly esteemed in heathen
countries.”</p>

<p>“Drop girl-babies <i>into</i> it?” asked Blanche
Jones. “Doesn’t it hurt them?”</p>

<p>“Not much, I believe; but it kills them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Lee!” It was Mary who
spoke, in tones of horror.</p>

<p>“The tower is half full of lime, and the
lime stops their breath. So I presume they
hardly suffer at all.”</p>

<p>Mary’s eyes were full of tears, and she
sprang up eagerly, exclaiming,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Lee! Oh, mamma, did you
hear that? I declare, it’s too bad! Can’t
the missionaries stop their killing babies so?”</p>

<p>“You sweet child,” said Mrs. Lee.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Gray only said,—</p>

<p>“Yes, my daughter, the missionaries are
doing their best; but everything can’t be
done in a day.”</p>

<p>“But it ought to be done this very minute,
mamma.”</p>

<p>Mary’s whole face glowed; and Mrs. Lee,
who sat directly in front of her, could not
refrain from leaning over the pew and kissing
her.</p>

<p>“We ought to bring more money, seems
to me,” suggested good, moon-faced Blanche
Jones, pressing her fat hands together.</p>

<p>“Yes, a cent every Sunday is too little,”
said one of Mrs. Gray’s little boys.</p>

<p>“Yes, a cent <i>is</i> too little,” agreed Fanny
Townsend earnestly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“How thoughtless we’ve been,” said
Mary, in high excitement. “For my part,
I mean to give those Chinese every cent of
my pin-money this month. Do you care if I
do, mamma?”</p>

<p>“No; you have my full consent. Only do
not make up your mind in a hurry,” replied
Mrs. Gray; but her manner was cold in comparison
with Mrs. Lee’s cordial hand-shake
and “God bless you, my precious girl.”</p>

<p>“I’m a real pet with Mrs. Lee,” thought
Mary, her heart throbbing high.</p>

<p>Blanche, Fanny, and the two older girls in
the class,—Sadie Patten and Lucy Abbott,—were
silent. They knew that Mary’s pin-money
amounted to four dollars a month, and
though they had thought of doing something
themselves, this brilliant offer discouraged
them at once: they could not make up their
minds to anything so munificent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Going home that noon, Mary “walked on
thorns,” though she tried to be humble. By
the next day, her feelings toward the Chinese
had undergone a slight chill; and when
her mother alluded to Captain Emerson—Mrs.
Lee’s uncle—and his pictures, Mary
did not care to converse on the subject. She
even felt a pang of regret at the recollection
of her hasty promise. Those girl-babies
were far off now; she could not see them in
imagination, as at first. Days passed, and
the poor things were fading out of mind,
buried deep in the lime of the tower.</p>

<p>“My daughter,” said Mrs. Gray, on Saturday,
“let me see your portmonnaie.” It
contained three dollars and a half now. Mrs.
Gray counted the bills. “Have you any
especial use for this money, Mary?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. <i>Would</i> you buy those
stereoscopic views of Rome and the Alps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
that Mr. Snow said I could choose from different
sets?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray smiled quietly.</p>

<p>“What good will the views do the babies
in China?”</p>

<p>There was a sudden droop of Mary’s head.</p>

<p>“Why, mamma, as true as you live I forgot
all about those babies; I really did!
You see, mamma, I didn’t stop to think last
Sunday. Must I give all my money to Mrs.
Lee—three dollars and a half?”</p>

<p>“To Mrs. Lee? I was under the impression
that you were to give it to the missionaries
to convert the Chinese.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, but I <i>said</i> it to Mrs. Lee;
the missionaries don’t know anything about
it.”</p>

<p>“So it seems,” returned Mrs. Gray dryly;
“you said it to Mrs. Lee merely to please
<i>her</i>.” Mary’s head sank still lower. “Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
you might ask Mrs. Lee to let you off, my
daughter.”</p>

<p>“But, mamma, how it would look to go to
her and ask that! I couldn’t!”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll be obliged to give the
money,” responded Mrs. Gray unfeelingly.
How easily she might have said, “Never
mind, Mary, I will see Mrs. Lee and arrange
it for you.” And she was usually a thoughtful,
obliging mother. Mary pressed the bills
together in her hand, spread them out tenderly,
gazed at them as if she loved them.
It was a large sum, and looked larger
through her tears.</p>

<p>“I can’t ask Mrs. Lee to let me off; you
know I can’t, mamma. I’d rather lose the
money!”</p>

<p>“Lose the money!” So that was the way
she regarded it! A strange sort of benevolence
surely!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>Take heed, therefore, that ye do not your
alms before men to be seen of them; otherwise
ye have no reward of your Father which is in
heaven.</i>” This was Mr. Lee’s text next day.</p>

<p>“Oh, that means me,” groaned Mary inwardly.
“I’ve been seen of Mrs. Lee, and
I’ve been seen of Blanche and Fanny and
the other girls; and that’s just what I did it
for, and <i>not</i> for the people in China! Oh,
dear! oh, dear! to think what a humbug
I am!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>OLD BLUFF.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now we come to an episode of the
highest importance to five young misses of
Laurel Grove. General Townsend owned an
unoccupied house about two miles from town,
at the foot of a steep hill called Old Bluff;
and it had occurred to the active mind of
Mary Gray that this would be a fine place for
“camping out.”</p>

<p>It was April when she hinted this to Fanny
Townsend, but it was May before Fanny
spoke of it to her father.</p>

<p>“I’m waiting till some time when you
come to my house to tea, Dandelina; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
we mustn’t get to laughing, now you remember.”</p>

<p>Mary seated herself at the Townsend tea-table
one evening with nervous dread; for,
next to Mrs. Prim, Mrs. Townsend inspired
her with more awe than any other lady in
town. When she thought it time for Fanny
to speak, she touched her foot under the table,
and Fanny began.</p>

<p>“Papa, I have something to say.”</p>

<p>Fanny had the feeling that she was not
highly reverenced by her family, on account
of her unfortunate habit of giggling; but her
face was serious enough now. “Papa, may
we girls go down to the farm next summer,—to
that house with the roses ’round it,—and
camp out? The girls all want to, and we—we’re
going to call it Camp Comfort.” (The
reader will perceive that this explains the
letters “C. C.”) She was sorry next moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
that she had spoken, for her mother
said, just as she had feared she might, “What
will you think of next, Fanny?”</p>

<p>But her father seemed only amused.
“Camp out? We girls? How many may
ye be? And who? Going to take your servants?”</p>

<p>“You’ll each need a watch-dog,” suggested
Fanny’s elder brother, Jack.</p>

<p>“You’ll come home nights, I presume,—servants,
watch-dogs and all,” said her father.</p>

<p>“O no, indeed! It wouldn’t be camping
out if we came home nights! And nobody
has a dog but Fanny, and we shouldn’t want
any servants,” cried Mary Gray, whose views
of labor seemed to have changed materially.</p>

<p>“We intend to do our own work,” remarked
Fanny. Whereupon everybody laughed;
and General Townsend asked again who the
girls were? “Oh, Flaxie Frizzle and Blanche<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Jones and I, papa; that makes three, rather
young; and then Sadie Patten and Lucy
Abbott, they’re rather old; that makes five.
Sadie and Lucy will be the mothers,—I
mean if you let us go.”</p>

<p>“That ‘if’ is well put in,” said brother
Jack.</p>

<p>“But what will you do for a stove?” asked
General Townsend, wishing to hear their
plans, “there’s none in the house.”</p>

<p>“My mamma has a rusty stove, and our
Henry Mann could take it to Old Bluff,” replied
Mary.</p>

<p>“But there’s no furniture,—not a chair or
a table.”</p>

<p>“They have too many chairs at Major
Patten’s and Mr. Jones’s; their houses are
running over with chairs.”</p>

<p>“Well, what about dishes?”</p>

<p>“Why, papa,” said Fanny eagerly, “only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
think what lots of dishes <i>we</i> have, just
oceans, all broken to pieces!”</p>

<p>“Ah, shall you eat from broken dishes?”
asked Mrs. Townsend coolly. “And perhaps
you’ll sleep on the floor?”</p>

<p>“O no, Mrs. Townsend, our house is full
of beds! Mamma has some of them put in
the stable, and Blanche Jones’s house is full
of beds, and they have to keep some of them
in the attic. Everybody has everything;
we’ve talked it all over. And there’s our
big express wagon, and our Henry Mann to
drive.”</p>

<p>Mary paused for breath.</p>

<p>“Yes, papa, Dr. Gray’s express wagon is
very large; and we have a push-cart, you
know. So can’t we go?” coaxed Fanny,
true to first principles.</p>

<p>“What have <i>I</i> to do about it, little Miss
Townsend? It seems you have already made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
your plans and invited your guests. How
happened you to think to ask my permission
for the rent of the house.”</p>

<p>“Finish your supper, Frances, and do not
sit there with your bread in the air,” said
Mrs. Townsend in a decided tone. “You
forget that I am to be consulted as well as
your father. And that’s not all. I’ve
no idea that Dr. Gray, or Major Patten, or
Mr. Jones, or Mrs. Abbott will consent to
this camping out, as you call it; so you must
not set your hearts on it, you and Flaxie.”</p>

<p>But it chanced that every one of the parents
did consent at last; and one morning in
the latter part of June you might have seen
some very busy girls loading a push-cart and
an express wagon, with the help of their
brothers and Henry Mann, while Fanny
laughed almost continually, and Mary Gray
exclaimed at intervals,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“O won’t it be a state of bliss?”</p>

<p>There were four bedsteads, eight chairs,
one old sofa, one table, one rusty stove, a
variety of old dishes,—not broken ones,—beside
a vast amount of rubbish, which the
mothers thought quite useless, but which
the daughters assured them would be “just
the thing for our charades.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to Old Bluff to assist in
such performances as charades, so you may
just count me out,” said Preston, who was
to take turns with Bert Abbott in being a
nightly guest at Camp Comfort; since the
parents would not consent that the girls
should spend one night there alone.</p>

<p>“As if boys were the least protection,”
said Lucy Abbott, Preston’s cousin.</p>

<p>“Still they may be useful in getting up
games,” returned Sadie Patten hopefully.
“And Jack Townsend’s cornet is charming.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“So it is; it goes so well with your harmonica.
And we’ll make the boys stir the
ice cream,” said Lucy, the head housekeeper.</p>

<p>There was an ice-house connected with
their cottage, and ice cream was to be permitted
on Sundays, and lemonade at pleasure.</p>

<p>“But where are the lemons?” said Mary,
flying about in everybody’s way.</p>

<p>“Oh, we shall buy fresh lemons every
morning of our grocer who comes to our
door,” said Lucy grandly. “What I want
to know is, if my hammock was packed?—Children,
did you see three hammocks in
that push-cart?—Boys, I hope you’ll hang
up those hammocks before we get there!
Don’t go racing now and spilling out things!—There,
I don’t believe anybody thought
to put in that spider,” added she anxiously,
as the five girls had bidden good-by to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
families in the cool of the morning, and were
walking in a gay procession toward their
house in the country.</p>

<p>Old Bluff was a steep, though not very high
mountain on the Canada side, and if it is not
gone, it stands there yet, hanging defiantly
over the blue brook called the <i>river</i> Dee, and
throwing its huge shadow from shore to
shore.</p>

<p>Old Bluff is a stern, bareheaded peak, and
few are the flowers that dare show their faces
near it. It is chiefly the hardy wintergreen
and disconsolate little sprigs of pine and
spruce which huddle together along its
sides.</p>

<p>At the foot of this famous bluff, on the
New York side, stood General Townsend’s
old-fashioned farm-house, a story and a half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
high, with a white picket fence around it, and
a red barn at one side. The house many
years ago had been white; and the panes of
glass in the windows were not only very
small, but weather-stained and streaked with
rainbow hues. London Pride or “Bouncing
Bet” grew near the broad front door-stone,
together with a few bunches of southernwood,
which Dr. Gray thought had a finer
odor than any geranium. The front yard was
grassy, and the fence lined with roses of
various sorts.</p>

<p>It was the first summer for years that this
pleasant old place had been vacant, and now
it might be applied for any day; but meanwhile
the five girls, called “the quintette,”
and the three attendant cavaliers, called “the
trio,” were welcome to rusticate in it, and
call it a “camp” if they chose.</p>

<p>After the furniture was set up, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
had been a reasonable amount of play at hide
and seek in the barn, and the first supper had
been eaten—the tablecloth proving to be
too small for the table—Mary went to one
of the front “rainbow-windows” to watch for
Preston.</p>

<p>“I mean to be a true woman.”</p>

<p>This was what she usually said to herself
when resolved not to cry. But there <i>was</i>
something lonesome in the thought of going
to bed without kissing her mother.</p>

<p>“Nobody else feels as I do, and I wouldn’t
mention it for anything; but I’d give one
quarter of my pin money—one whole dollar—to
see mamma and Ethel.”</p>

<p>She had supposed that in camping out all
care would be left behind. Her mother had
excused her from lessons and sewing, and she
had looked for “a state of bliss;” but it is
forever true—and Mary was beginning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
find it so—that wherever we are, there is
“something still to do and bear.”</p>

<p>Homesickness was a constitutional weakness
with Mary, but she disdained the cowardice
of running home; she would be a “true
woman,” and crack walnuts to please Lucy.</p>

<p>“Well, this is a hard-working family,” said
Preston, arriving presently in state on his
bicycle, as Lucy and Sadie were engaged in
putting the supper dishes in the kitchen cupboard.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Gray; and we allow no idlers
here. Please may I ask what ails our window
shades, sir?”</p>

<p>The poor old green-cloth curtains were
tearing away from the gentle clasp of Sadie
Patten’s tack-nails, and leaning over from the
tops of the windows as if already tired of the
sun and wanting a little rest.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s see your hammer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I’m using it, I’m a young lady now
and do as I please,” cried Mary, springing up
from the kitchen hearth, and scattering her
walnuts broadcast, “catch me if you can.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? Well, then, now for a race
from here to the sweet-apple tree. One, two,
three, begin!” And Preston started off at
the top of his speed, Mary just before him,
her face aglow, her hair streaming in the
wind. As she skimmed over the ground,
shouting and laughing, she seemed for all the
world like a little girl, and not in the least
like a young lady. She was soon caught and
obliged to surrender the hammer, whereupon
Preston nailed the curtains neatly, and went
whistling about the house, giving finishing
touches here and there to the rickety furniture.</p>

<p>“O thank you. You’ve been a great help.
Now, in return, you shall have a spring-bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
to sleep on, the only one we have in the
house,” said Lucy, with a mischievous glance
at Sadie.</p>

<p>The spring-bed did not fit the bedstead,
and the chances were that it might fall
through in the night.</p>

<p>“You’re too tremendously kind, too self-sacrificing,”
said Preston, suspecting at once
that something was wrong.</p>

<p>But he had his revenge. The bedstead
was extremely noisy, and the roguish youth,
unable to sleep himself on account of mosquitoes,
rejoiced to think that he was probably
keeping his cousin Lucy awake.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Preston, I hope you rested
well,” said she, as they all met next morning
in the front yard.</p>

<p>“O very.—it’s <i>so</i> quiet in the country,”
returned he demurely. “Did you ever <i>hear</i>
anything so quiet?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“Never; except possibly a saw-mill,” said
Sadie Patten. “Lucy and I wondered if you
could be alive, you were so still!”</p>

<p>“It <i>was</i> sort of frightful. No sound broke
the awful silence, save the warning voice of
the mosquito.—By the way, girls, why don’t
you call this spot Mosquito Ranch?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what we used to call it at our
house,—we always called it ‘Down to the
Farm,’” remarked little Fanny.</p>

<p>“It ought to be Rose Villa,” said Lucy.
“Just see our rose-tree that reaches almost
to the eaves. We measured it yesterday,
and it’s seven feet high.”</p>

<p>“That will do for a tree,” said Preston,
plucking one of the pure, white roses and
thrusting it into his button-hole; “but you
can’t eat roses, you know.”</p>

<p>He had built a fire in the kitchen stove,
but the young ladies seemed to have forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
entirely that there was such a thing in the
world as breakfast.</p>

<p>“O, yes, we must prepare our simple morning
meal,” said cousin Lucy. “Girls, where’s
my blue-checked apron? Preston, we’ve
heard there are lovely trout in that brook
across the field. Not the <i>river</i>-brook.”</p>

<p>“Have you, really? Then I go a-fishing;
I’d rather do that than starve.—No, Fan,
you needn’t come, I won’t have anybody with
me but Flaxie.”</p>

<p>Very proud was Mary that she could be
trusted to keep silence in the presence of the
wise and wary trout. It was beautiful there
by the brook-side, in the still June morning,
sitting and watching the “shadowy water,
with a sweet south wind blowing over it.”
There was no house within half a mile, and
perhaps the Peck family and the Brown
family—the nearest neighbors—were still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
asleep, for there was no sound, except the
“song-talk” of the birds, and the whisper of
the wind through the trees. It was a very
light whisper, reminding Preston of the
words,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 7em;">“And then there crept</span></div>
<div class="verse">A little noiseless noise among the leaves,</div>
<div class="verse">Born of the very sigh that silence heaves.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Mary’s breath was a “noiseless noise,” too;
it hardly stirred the folds of her buff print
dress; it was the very “sigh” of “silence,”
and Preston thought he should tell her so,
and praise her when they got home; but it
happened that he forgot it.</p>

<p>The trout came, as they usually did when
he called for them; but it must be confessed
that they were never eaten. Lucy put them
in the spider, Sadie salted, Fanny turned, and
finally Blanche Jones burned them. The
“morning meal” was as “simple” as need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
be, with cold bread and butter, cold tongue,
and muddy, creamless coffee, the milk having
turned sour. In the midst of their repast,
the young campers were surprised by a loud
peal of the door-bell.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>CAMP COMFORT.</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Buttons</span>,” said Lucy to her cousin Preston,
“you’ll have to go to the door.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Sadie, “as Buttons is the
only servant we keep, he must answer the
bell.”</p>

<p>Preston obeyed, laughing. A droll little
image of dirt and rags stood at the door,
holding a ten-quart tin pail.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” said Preston, surprised
at the shrewd, unchildlike expression of her
face, for she was perhaps twelve years old
and looked forty. The little girl seemed
equally surprised. “What’s them things?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
said she, pointing to Preston’s spectacles.
“What do you wear ’em for?”</p>

<p>“Do you want anything, little girl?”
asked he, frowning, or trying to frown.</p>

<p>“I say, what do you wear glasses for?
<i>You</i> ain’t an old man.”</p>

<p>“No matter what I wear them for—”
very sternly. “Do you want anything,
child?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I came to ax you for some swifts.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by swifts?”</p>

<p>“Lor now, don’t you know what swifts is?
Swifts is something folks reels yarn on.”</p>

<p>“Well, we haven’t any in this house, little
girl, and if that’s all you came for, you’d
better run home.”</p>

<p>“Hain’t got no swifts?” shuffling forward
with her small, bare feet, and peeping into
the house through her straggling locks of
hair. “Well, you’ve got a spin-wheel,
hain’t ye?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, we’ve nothing you want. You’d
better go.”</p>

<p>By that time Mary and Fanny were at the
sitting-room door, curious to see the stranger.</p>

<p>“How d’ye do? Do you children live
here all alone? Guess I’ll come in,” said
the waif, brushing past Preston, who did not
choose to keep her out by main force, and
entering the sitting-room where the breakfast-table
was spread. “I live over t’other
side of Bluff. My name’s Pancake.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know who you are then,” said
Fanny, not very cordially; for she had heard
her father speak of a poor, half-starved, vagrant
family of that name; harmless, he
believed, but not very desirable neighbors.</p>

<p>“My name’s <i>Pecy</i> Pancake,” added the
waif obligingly, and bent her snub nose to
sniff the burnt trout.</p>

<p>“<i>Peace</i>, probably,” said Preston, aside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, <i>Pecielena</i>. Hain’t you got no lasses
cake? Oh, what cunning little sassers;”
handling the salt glasses. “Where’s the
cups to ’em? How came you children to
come here alone?”</p>

<p>“We came because we <i>chose</i>,” said Mary,
with crushing emphasis.</p>

<p>“We <i>wished</i> to come,” said Fanny, trying
to be as dignified as Mary, though she felt
her inferiority in this respect always.</p>

<p>In no wise disconcerted, Miss Pecielena
Pancake started on a tour of observation
about the room.</p>

<p>“You look like you’d been burnt out or
somethin’. Who does your work? Got any
cow? Oh, you hain’t? Well, <i>I’ve</i> got a
cow. This here is my milk bucket. I’ll
fetch ye some milk.”</p>

<p>“No, no, no,” exclaimed Lucy, in alarm.
“Our milk is to be brought from town.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is, hey? Well, I’ll fetch you some sour
milk; five cents a quart.”</p>

<p>“Don’t take the trouble,” said Sadie
mildly; “we are not fond of sour milk.”</p>

<p>After a long inspection of the room, Pecy
gazed observantly out of the window.</p>

<p>“Look here! What’s them things hanging
up in the trees? Look like fish-nets.
I’ve seen folks in Rosewood swing in just
such; be they swings?—Well, I reckon I
must be a-goin’. But we paster our cow this
side the river, and I’ll call agin when I come
to milk.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible that creature is really
gone?”</p>

<p>“Hope she stayed just as long as she wished
to,” said Lucy, shutting the door forcibly.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s only half civilized, and doesn’t
know any better,” returned the more charitable
Sadie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“Young ladies,” said Preston, flourishing
his arms preparatory to a speech, “it seems
you have settled in a refined and cultivated
neighborhood—<i>very!</i> I never knew before
why you couldn’t stay at home; but I now
see that Laurel Grove is unworthy of you.
You pined for the advantages of elevated,
intellectual society, such as can be found
only at Old Bluff.”</p>

<p>“Buttons,” said Lucy, shaking the broom
at him, “we permit no impertinence from
servants. Go, pump a pail of water directly,
and then you may wipe the dishes.”</p>

<p>Preston “struck an attitude” again.</p>

<p>“Honored ladies, there’s a limit to all
things. Buttons will cook, he will answer
door-bells, he will scrub, if need be; but
wipe dishes he will not, <i>no</i>, not if you flay
him alive! Farewell! Once again, farewell!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t go, Preston,” entreated Mary, as
her brother mounted his “steed,” the bicycle;
“do stay to dinner.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t; might starve.”</p>

<p>“Fie, Buttons,” cried the older girls,
“you’re no gentleman!”</p>

<p>“A servant is not expected to be a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“But do dine with us, <i>Mr. Gray</i>.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, not to-day. Good-by, I’ll
send Abbott to watch to-night.” Preston and
his cousin Bert Abbott, being in college
together, called each other by their surnames,
to the no small amusement of Bert’s
sister Lucy.</p>

<p>“He calls sleeping here ‘watching,’”
laughed Sadie, as Preston glided away, bowing
and waving his hand. “But here comes
our grocer. Why, who is that with him?”</p>

<p>For as the wagon stopped at the gate, Mr.
Fowler lifted a little girl over the wheels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“Kittyleen! Kittyleen Garland! Dear
me, where did you pick <i>her</i> up, Mr. Fowler?”</p>

<p>For it was not to be supposed that Kittyleen
came from home. She was an innocent
little truant, whose mother never objected
to her straying about the streets.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you, Kittyleen; you can go
and play in the barn with Flaxie and Fanny,”
said Lucy hospitably; and then, turning to
Sadie, “Now, what shall we order for dinner?”</p>

<p>Sadie looked helpless.</p>

<p>“What would <i>you</i> advise, Mr. Fowler?
Our fathers said we might have <i>anything</i>, and
they’d settle the bills; but I——”</p>

<p>“Lemons,” struck in Lucy, ashamed of
Sadie’s weakness.</p>

<p>“A dozen, and some fresh butter. Lard,—perhaps
ten pounds, for pies.”</p>

<p>“Anything else,” asked the grocer, deferentially,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
as he jotted these orders into a notebook.
“I’ll bring them to-morrow—a real
pretty situation here. What do you call it?
Old Maid’s Hall?”</p>

<p>“No, a convent,” said Sadie quickly, “for
we shall have to fast if you’re not coming
back with our groceries till to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Why, Miss Sadie, it’s all of two miles,
and it won’t pay to come twice a day,” said
the grocer, wiping his heated brows.</p>

<p>“Well, we shall have to fast, then. This
is a convent, as I told you, and we are nuns—<i>Capuchin</i>
nuns—for you know Capuchin
nuns are famous for fasting.”</p>

<p>“So they be,” laughed Mr. Fowler, though
it was the first time in his life he had ever
heard of a Capuchin nun; “so they be,”
and rode away laughing, to tell Dr. Gray and
Major Patten, whom he met in the village,
“that those children were having a high old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
time down there at the cottage, and were
bright as pins, every one of ’em.”</p>

<p>“They forgot to order meat, but hadn’t I
better take down some Cape Cod turkey to
keep off starvation?” He meant salt codfish.</p>

<p>“How do you suppose they’ll make way
with ten pounds of lard, though?”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” replied Dr. Gray, throwing
his head back to laugh; “they beg not to be
interfered with, and we’ll let them have their
own way for a while.”</p>

<p>Starvation was not likely to ensue for some
days, as the young campers had been bountifully
supplied by their mothers with bread,
pies, cake, and cold meats.</p>

<p>“Oh, housekeeping is just play and takes no
time at all,” said Sadie Patten; “now let’s
get up some charades and rehearse for to-morrow
night, and invite the three boys—Kittyleen
must be amused, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>The charade which follows was their first
attempt of the sort at Camp Comfort, the
music between the acts being supplied by
Jack Townsend’s cornet and Sadie Patten’s
harmonica.</p>


<h3>A PANTOMIME.</h3>

<p>The stage was out of doors. Two posts
were driven into the ground, and between
them hung the red table-cloth suspended
from a fish-line. This was the drop-curtain.</p>

<p>The audience, in chairs, or on the ground,
were directly in front of the stage. At a
whistle from the invisible depths the drop-curtain
was raised by Blanche Jones, revealing
the manager, Preston Gray, who
made a low bow, and said, “Ladies and
gentlemen, it is with profound pleasure that
I present to you the two stars of tragedy,
Madame Graylocks, of the Tuscarora Opera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Company, and Don Albertus of the Cannibal
Islands.”</p>

<p>The two “stars” then step forward, to be
greeted by the audience with deafening
cheers. Miss Graylocks (alias Mary Gray),
her face and hands well stained with walnut-juice,
is clad in blue jacket, gray skirt and
red-topped boots (Sadie Patten called them
“galligaskins”), with a stove-pipe hat on her
head. An ounce of black worsted floats
down her shoulders for hair. She makes a
deep courtesy, Don Albertus (Bert Abbott)
a low bow.</p>

<p>He is an Indian chief, clad in a red and
green dressing-gown, with a feather duster on
his head for a war-plume. His face, like
Madame Graylocks’, is a fine mahogany color.</p>

<p>Their “unrivalled performance,” announces
the manager, “is to be a charade in two
syllables.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>


<h3>FIRST SYLLABLE.</h3>

<p>The stage is now observed to be strewn
with sticks and twigs, to resemble the outskirts
of a forest. No word is spoken; but
as a tin pail hangs on a pole over something
that looks like a fireplace, it would seem that
the worthy couple are keeping house, and
that the squaw is preparing dinner. But as
yet there is no fire. The squaw collects
branches and twigs, lays them crosswise
under the tin pail. Her lord and master seats
himself on the ground, watching her in
scowling silence. The soup must boil; but
how can she make a fire? She rubs two
stones together Indian-fashion, but cannot
strike a spark. She tries with all her might,
dancing up and down and shaking her head
dolefully. The chief laughs at her, offering
no help, till she points in despair to the tin
pail, reminding him that at this rate they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
must starve. He rises then, pushes her aside,
and flashing his white teeth at her, seizes
the two stones, rubs them just once together,
and they instantly ignite (of course this
is done by means of a match hidden in his
sleeve.) The twigs are soon crackling under
the pail. He points his finger disdainfully at
the poor squaw, who cannot make a fire.
She looks so brow-beaten and discouraged at
this, so unlike the spirited Flaxie Frizzle of
real life, that the audience laugh. Then the
drop-curtain falls.</p>


<h3>SECOND SYLLABLE.</h3>

<p>The soup has boiled, the chief has dined,
and now sits with hands folded, looking good-natured.
The pail is empty and lying bottom
upward on the grass. Enter his meek wife;
takes the empty pail; returns with it full of
water, slopping it as she walks. The thirsty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
chief points to his mouth. She produces
a large iron spoon, fills it and gives him to
drink, afterwards helping herself. They sit
and sip from the spoon alternately, when
a “pale face” (Preston) enters, with a jug.
The chief starts up with eager delight. Pale
Face swings the jug slowly, to show that it
is full. The chief, smiling and obsequious,
advances to shake hands. The squaw looks
alarmed; shakes her head at the jug, and
insists on giving Pale Face some water. Pale
Face declines it; takes stopper out of jug
and presents it to chief’s nose with an eloquent
gesture, which means, “Now <i>isn’t</i> that
good?”</p>

<p>It is evidently whiskey, for the chief sniffs
the stopper, laughs and dances, pointing to
his mouth.</p>

<p>Squaw weeps; is evidently a good temperance
woman; holds the pail to her husband’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
lips. He pushes her away, and begs in
dumb show for the whiskey.</p>

<p>Faithful squaw shakes her stovepipe hat,
wrings her worsted hair, chases Pale Face
around and around the stage, trying to make
him give up the fatal jug. In vain; chief
is allowed to get it; raises it joyfully to his
lips.</p>

<p>Faithful squaw, becoming frantic, seizes
the pail, and, overdoing her part, pours all
the water over Pale Face, drenching him
completely.</p>

<p>“Oo! Oo!” he gurgles. “If that isn’t
just like you, Flaxie Frizzle!”</p>

<p>Blanche hurries down the drop curtain.
Scene closes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“I thought there was no talking in a pantomime,”
laughed the audience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Third Scene.</span><br />

<i>The Whole Word.</i></h3>

<p>It now appears that the whiskey which
Pale Face mischievously brought has wrought
its dreadful work. The proud war-plume of
the chief dangles ignominiously over his left
ear; his copper-colored cheeks and nose are
blazing red (painted with Chinese vermilion).
He tries to walk; reels like a ship in a
storm.</p>

<p>His devoted wife has certainly tried her
very best to save him from this degradation;
but, like any bad husband, he only hates her
for it, and has made up his drunken mind
to kill her. Seizing her by the yarn of the
head, he is actually scalping her with the
lemon-squeezer, when little Kittyleen, who
can bear no more, cries out,—</p>

<p>“Stop, stop, you shan’t hurt my Flaxie!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>This timely interference does not save the
squaw’s life, however,—or not entirely. Her
head comes off,—or at any rate, the hat
and the ounce of worsted. But ere she falls
to rise no more, she turns—with remarkable
presence of mind for a dying woman—and
points to the whiskey-jug, scowling furiously
at it, as if to assure the audience that it is
the jug and <i>not</i> the lemon-squeezer that has
caused her death.</p>


<h3><i>Curtain falls.</i></h3>

<p>Before any one had time to say, “Now
guess the word,” Jack Townsend, known by
the campers as “the Electric Light,” on account
of his red head, exclaimed, “It’s <i>Fire
Water</i>, isn’t it? That’s the Indian name for
whiskey. I guessed it by the waterfall in
the second syllable.”</p>

<p>“No wonder you did; there was water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
enough in that syllable to put out all the fire
in the first one!” exclaimed Preston, springing
for his bicycle, to fly home and change
his wet clothes.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>PUDDING AND PIES.</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">There’s</span> that dreadful little Pancake
ringing again. She comes every morning,
Preston, and you must stop it,” said cousin
Lucy, waving away half a dozen flies from
the sugar-bowl, with as much vehemence as
she could throw into her napkin.</p>

<p>“Troublesome flies,” said Preston, without
heeding his cousin’s request. “They say a
barn-swallow will eat a thousand a day;
wish <i>we</i> had a barn-swallow.”</p>

<p>Lucy went to the door a trifle crossly,
bread-knife hard in hand, as if she meant
to charge it at the foe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“And <i>now</i> what do you want?”</p>

<p>For it seemed as if the little gipsy must
have exhausted all the errands that could
possibly be thought of.</p>

<p>“Could I borry a piece o’ stovepipe—’bout
<i>so</i> long—I’ll fetch it back to morry.”</p>

<p>“A piece of stovepipe!”</p>

<p>Lucy would not have smiled on any account.</p>

<p>“Yes, mammy’s sick, and our stovepipe’s
rusted off. I’ll fetch it home to morry.”</p>

<p>And before Lucy had time to prevent it, the
little try-patience had rushed past her, and
effected an entrance into the breakfast room.
And, as if her own presence were not unwelcome
enough, she was followed by a
large, formidable-looking bee.</p>

<p>“Don’t you be scared,” said Pecielena, as
the children all screamed. “I’ll catch him
and kill him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, no,” cried Mary. “I belong to the
society for cruelty to animals. I can’t let
you kill him.”</p>

<p>But Pecy had already caught the bee and
crushed him against the table-cloth with the
broom-handle.</p>

<p>Sadie looked at Lucy, the “lady abbess,”
to see how long she meant to allow such behavior
to go on; but Lucy had become discouraged,
and was retreating to the kitchen.</p>

<p>“I must go and pick over the rice for
dinner. I suppose <i>you</i> don’t know, Sadie,
whether three pounds will make pudding
enough for six people?” said she, putting
the rice in the only kettle the house afforded,
and pouring over it two quarts of water.
No, Sadie did not know.</p>

<p>The unbidden guest, forgetting that her
cow had not been milked, stood looking on,
as saucy as an English cuckoo in a hedge-sparrow’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
nest. It would not appear that
she intended the least harm; she was simply
a little half-starved, wild creature, and the
sight of the raisins gave her a hungry longing,
which Lucy was unable to comprehend,
or she would have admired the poor thing’s
self-denial in not teasing, and would have
given her gladly a handful of the coveted
sweets.</p>

<p>Camp Comfort, with its merry, careless
child-tenants and abundance of food, seemed
an earthly paradise to wretched little Pecy.
She had never ventured so boldly into any
other house, even the humble Browns and
Pecks, as into this one, which had no responsible
grown people in it; nobody really
old enough to command her to leave.</p>

<p>“Is this here your dog, Lucy?” said she,
caressing the pug. “His nose turns up some
like yours. I never see such a queer dog.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“And I never saw such a queer girl,” said
Lucy, reddening. “Are you the protector
of this family, Preston Gray? General
Townsend told mother he felt easy about us
with you here; but if you haven’t authority
enough to keep tramps away, perhaps we’ll
have to call on Bert or Jack.”</p>

<p>This sarcasm aroused Preston.</p>

<p>“Miss Pancake,” said he solemnly, “do
you see this gun?” taking it from the corner.
“Perhaps you may not know that I am a
soldier in the regular army; and when people
do not behave well it is my business to shoot
them.”</p>

<p>Pecielena was a shrewd child, and only
laughed.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t <i>dass</i> shoot me,” said she
confidently.</p>

<p>“Ah, you needn’t be so sure of that. Wait
and see. Now I’m going to ask you six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
questions; and do you step toward the door
every time you answer one. And if you are
not out of the door by the time the last one
is answered——”</p>

<p>The sentence was left unfinished, but
there was an awful gleam of spectacles, a
threatening wave of the gun, and Preston’s
appearance was most military and imposing.</p>

<p>“Do you know how to read, little girl?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then step.”</p>

<p>She slowly obeyed.</p>

<p>“Do you ever go to church?”</p>

<div class="caption">BUTTONS PREPARING TO “COOK A PIE.”—<span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_138">Page 138.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Do your father and mother ever go to
church?”</p>

<p>“No,”—moving forward now of her own
accord, with some haste toward the door.</p>

<p>“O you’re gone, are you? Well, little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
girl, you needn’t call again. Do you
hear?”</p>


<p>“There, that’s splendid,” said Sadie admiringly.
“To think what a little heathen she
is! Do you suppose it’s safe to live near
such people?”</p>

<p>“We shan’t have any more trouble from
<i>her</i>, I’m thinking,” returned the “protector
of the family,” feeling that he had vindicated
his character.</p>

<p>But little Mary was not quite satisfied.
This behavior was hardly in accordance with
the daily precepts and examples of her parents,
who had taught her that she ought to
pity and try to help the poor, ignorant, and
unfortunate.</p>

<p>She pondered on the subject at intervals all
the morning, as she sat in the hammock,
amusing her devoted little friend, Kittyleen.
Pecy looked as if she never had a good time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
in her life. Was it fair to drive her away?
Could she herself do anything for the child?
If so, what, and how?</p>

<p>Fanny and Blanche were off in the meadow
making daisy-wreaths as a pretty surprise
for to-night’s ice-cream party. In the house
Sadie arranged pond lilies in a cracked bowl,
repeating to Preston the stanza,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“From the reek of the pond, the lily</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Has risen in raiment white,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A spirit of air and water,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A form of incarnate light.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Sadie is too hifalutin’ for anything,”
thought Lucy, who had the rice pudding on
her hands. Ah, that pudding!</p>

<p>Lucy had forgotten, or did not know, that
rice has a habit of swelling. Before long it
had risen to the top of the kettle and was
overflowing it, like an eruption of lava down
the sides of a volcano.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, look, look,” cried Sadie, “it’s like
the genius in the Arabian Nights, that flew
out when the bottle was opened, and grew
to a great steam giant!”</p>

<p>“Can’t stop to talk fairy stories. Get the
spider!” cried Lucy.</p>

<p>She filled the spider from the bubbling,
dripping kettle.</p>

<p>“The pudding dish! Big platter!”</p>

<p>The white-hot spirit of the mischievous
rice was just beginning his frolic.</p>

<p>“The pitcher!”</p>

<p>The steam giant was still rising, growing,
dancing ever upward.</p>

<p>“Sugar bowl! Pour out the sugar on the
table! All the plates.—O, dear, all the cups
and saucers!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want the teaspoons? Here,
let’s stop this nonsense,” said Preston. And
coming to the rescue, he swung off the kettle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and poured the bewitched contents upon the
grass at the back door.</p>

<p>“Oh, you extravagant creature! You’ve
wasted three pounds of rice and half a pound
of raisins, and killed the grass!”</p>

<p>Preston gazed in inward consternation at
the ruinous white flood; but he was not
going to confess his sins to cousin Lucy.</p>

<p>“That’s the proper way to serve rice pudding,”
said he. “Always serve hot, and
make it go as far as you can. Now let the
children pick out the plums.”</p>

<p>“But our pudding’s gone.”</p>

<p>“I’ll cook a pie,” replied he, with alacrity.
“I cooked ’em last summer at the lakes fit to
set before a king.”</p>

<p>Laughing was the very mainspring of life
at Camp Comfort; but the girls had never
laughed yet as they did now, to see Buttons
in full swing preparing to “cook a pie.” Lucy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
kindly summoned every member of the family
to witness the performance. The taking-off
of his coat, the pinning-up of his sleeves,
the tying-on of an apron, the swathing of the
head in a towel, the cleansing of hands with
sand-soap and nail-brush; and Buttons was
ready for action.</p>

<p>“Now,” said he, drawing a long breath
and looking authoritatively through his spectacles.
“Now, bring on the flour and things,
and butter some plates.—Lard, butter, knife,
spoon.—Where’s your milk? No, water
won’t do. I prefer milk. Bring me half a
cup.—Where’s your salt?”</p>

<p>He carefully measured out a half-cup of
equal parts of butter and lard, and rubbed it
into a pint of flour.</p>

<p>“Now, cream tartar and soda.”</p>

<p>The girls brought them with a growing
feeling of respect. He stirred two teaspoonfuls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
of cream tartar into the flour, dissolved half
as much soda in the milk, mixed all together
rapidly, and rolled the mass on the board.</p>

<p>“I hope ’twill be better than the pie we
had yesterday, that was baked in the spider,”
said Mary, not heeding Lucy’s frown.</p>

<p>“How tough that was,” said Blanche.
“What did Lucy put in to make it so tough?”</p>

<p>“She didn’t put in much of anything,”
replied Fanny. “Jack said you could have
cut it with a pair of scissors, ’twas so thin.”</p>

<p>“Hush, children, the rest of us couldn’t
have done as well,” said Sadie, leaning over
the table, watching Preston’s efforts. “What
shall you fill it with?”</p>

<p>The question startled him: he had not
thought of the inside of the pie.</p>

<p>“Oh, almost anything,” said he, carefully
trimming the edges of the lower crust.</p>

<p>“Are there any lemons?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, Jack used a dozen yesterday for one
pitcher of lemonade,” said Lucy.</p>

<p>“But we have some very green apples if
the children haven’t eaten them all.”</p>

<p>“Fly round then and slice ’em.”</p>

<p>“How impertinent!” cried the whole
family. “Take notice, <i>this</i> is the way Buttons
makes pies.”</p>

<p>But they “flew round,” all five of them,
and picked some very green currants off the
bushes in the back yard with merry good
will.</p>

<p>“Now, behold me fill my pies,” said Preston,
slowly sifting a cup of sugar over the
bottom crust before he put in the currants.</p>

<p>“May I behold, too?” asked the grocer,
who stood at the side door. He had heard
the laughing half a mile away.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, this is my cooking school.”</p>

<p>“Well, go on with your lecture. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
make a real pretty picture standing there
with that rig on.”</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, I was about to
remark, it’s truly lamentable, the ignorance
of girls and women! They put the currants
in first and <i>then</i> the sugar, and the juice spills
out all over the oven.—See, here is the oven
ready. What have you been thinking of,
girls, to let that fire go out?”</p>

<p>“You see how he acts, Mr. Fowler,” said
Sadie, as Lucy put wood in the stove.</p>

<p>“But, as I was saying—sugar first, <i>then</i>
currants, and the juice stays in. Bring some
water to pour in, Flaxie.”</p>

<p>“Can’t I hire you to come and show my
women folks how to cook?” said the grocer,
laughing at the notion of placing sugar below
currants.</p>

<p>But there was reason in the “notion,” as
the event proved, for the juice did “stay in,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and the pie would have done Preston great
credit, if it had not been trifled with in the
oven, like all the Camp Comfort baking. But
it was far superior to Lucy’s spider-pie, and a
vote was taken on the spot for a change of
cooks.</p>

<p>Preston was jubilant, for was not this his
second victory for the day?</p>

<p>The weather was sultry, and after dinner
everybody would gladly have reclined in the
hammocks under the shade, if Lucy had not
suddenly remembered that ice-cream always
suggests cake. Lemon-cake was made and
burned; but the ice-cream party did not
come off on account of a heavy shower which
rose about six o’clock.</p>

<p>In the midst of it arrived the incorrigible
Pecielena Pancake with a new errand.
Preston was chagrined. Had he inspired her
with no real awe after all?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you got an ambril?”</p>

<p>An umbrella was useless now, for she was
thoroughly soaked and dripping with rain.</p>

<p>“I want to take it to the paster,” said she,
“so’s to keep the <i>milk</i> dry!”</p>

<p>“Go a-<i>way!</i>” exclaimed the campers in
concert; and at a signal from Preston they
all clapped hands, and pursued the astonished
little vagrant to the door. Everybody but
Mary. Somehow, as she looked at the poor,
wild creature, with the bright, restless, unhappy
eyes, a feeling of pity moved her.</p>

<p>“Be ye kindly affectioned one toward another.”
Did that mean tramps, too? She
had been thinking of it all day. She was
not sure. Of course, nobody wanted gipsy
children coming around to bother, especially
after they had been forbidden the house;
and Preston was a very, very good boy, every
body said so, and not likely to do anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
cruel. Still, it could not be denied that Pecy
Pancake was a human being, and that it was
raining. On the whole, Mary thought she
had done well not to help “clap her out.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>THE HAILSTORM.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">What</span> an evening that was! It had only
rained when Pecy came, but soon the rain
turned to hail, which the wind drove rattling
against the windows. It was a wild storm,
and they had sent the poor child forth, perhaps
to perish in it, simply because she was
disagreeable and wanted to borry “an ambril
to keep the milk dry.” Probably she had
never held an “ambril” in her life, and could
not resist the temptation to ask for one when
the opportunity offered.</p>

<p>Preston went to the door and called to her,
but she had run like a deer, and was already
out of sight and hearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> too bad,” said Lucy, “just look at
those hailstones as big as robins’ eggs! Did
that child have anything on her head?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Mary, pacing the floor excitedly,
“an old sunbonnet. But the hailstones
will strike right through it. Don’t
hailstones ever kill people?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t worry! It didn’t hail when we
sent her out, or we wouldn’t have done it, of
course. But she’s as tough as a pine-knot;
’twould take more than hailstones to kill
<i>her</i>,” said Preston; and then he whistled to
keep his courage up.</p>

<p>“Girls, if there’s an ‘ambril,’ let’s have it.
I’m going to the ‘paster,’ wherever it is, to
find her.”</p>

<p>And go he would and did, in spite of all
remonstrances. He was gone a long while,
and when he returned, the sky was clear
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I found her. <i>She’s</i> all right. She
had a quantity of ice-cream in her ‘milk-bucket’
to take home.”</p>

<p>“Did she row across the river?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I stood and watched her safe
over. I tell you she’s smarter than chain-lightning.”</p>

<p>He did not relate that he had found her
crying bitterly, and that she had evidently
suffered not only from fright but from
wounded feeling. She had uttered no word
of complaint, but her silent tears had given
him a feeling of remorse he would never forget.
He rose early next morning to caulk
the old boat which lay useless in the barn.
“Abbott” had promised to do it, but “Abbott”
and the “Electric Light” were both
inclined to forgetfulness, and all the hard
tasks were sure to fall, sooner or later, on
“the old man of the family.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“I believe the concern is seaworthy now,
and suppose we row across the river,” said
he, when breakfast was despatched.</p>

<p>There were six little cries of ecstasy. It
was “Dishes, take care of yourselves if you
can;” and, as for food, the flies seemed
disposed to take care of that.</p>

<p>It was a lovely morning, the atmosphere
being particularly bright and clear after last
night’s storm. Gorgeous red and gold butterflies
hovered in the air, a robin in the front
yard hopped along five steps, then stopped to
look at the campers, and the eastern morning
sun threw his shadow before him exactly his
own size.</p>

<p>“It’s a perfect state of bliss to go rowing
this morning,” exclaimed Mary, as they entered
the boat.</p>

<p>“’Twas all we needed to make us perfectly
happy,” remarked Sadie Patten, longing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
to repeat some poetry, but restrained by
fear of Lucy.</p>

<p>The river Dee, though remarkably deep,
was narrow and soon crossed.</p>

<p>“Let’s call on our Pancake friends before
we go any farther. What say?” said Preston,
helping the girls out of the boat.</p>

<p>It was just what he had come for; he
wished to set his conscience at rest about
Pecy; and the girls had understood and sympathized
all the while, without a word being
said.</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s call,” said they.</p>

<p>The Pancakes lived in a small red cottage.
Somebody says, “A red house blushes for
the man who painted it;” but this house
had more to blush for than that,—dirt and
disorder without and within. It was badly
weather-stained, and the windows were half
glass, half rags. Outside there were two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
old tubs, a rake with stumpy teeth, and a
mop lying across some battered tin pans.
The children around the door were as
shaggy-headed as their playmate, a lame old
dog; and indeed the only graceful object
about the premises was the soft blue smoke,
which was happy enough to escape from the
miserable house through the low chimney.</p>

<p>Here dwelt the family of Pancakes. The
father had once been a decent, though
“queer” man, living in Kentucky; but his
wife died, and her death seemed to turn his
brain and make him “queerer” than ever.
He married again, a miserable woman, belonging
to the sort of people in the South
called “Crackers;” and from that time he
did not seem to care what became of him.
After many wanderings he had settled at last
at Old Bluff, declaring he would not move
again. His wife could not read, and he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
given up books himself, and had no wish to
send his children to school or church. Pecy,
the eldest, was his first wife’s daughter, and
by far the brightest of them all; but the stepmother
made her a perfect drudge, and the
browbeaten child had scarcely a moment to
herself, except in going to and from the
“paster.” Her loiterings at Camp Comfort
had already caused her several beatings.
The family lived chiefly by hunting and fishing,
had nothing to do with their neighbors,
and of course sank lower and lower, and
grew poorer and poorer, though to their
credit it must be said that they had never
yet been known to steal.</p>

<p>Half a dozen children stood staring at
Preston as he knocked at the cottage door.
It was opened after some time by Mrs. Pancake,
who wore a blue and yellow calico
gown, falling in straight lines to her ankles;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and though her feet were bare, her head was
covered by a monstrous pink sun-bonnet,
shaped like a flour-scoop. She had a cup in
her hand, and was stirring the contents with
a yellow spoon.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” said Preston for his
whole party, who were grouped about him
in silence.</p>

<p>The woman did not return the greeting,
and they all felt that their presence was not
welcome.</p>

<p>“We came to inquire for your little girl.
We hope she did not take cold last night
in the rain; did she?”</p>

<p>“Wal, yes, she done took a fever cold,”
replied the woman crossly, pointing to a
bunch of straw on the floor, whereon lay a
child smelling at a rag rolled in tar. It
was Pecy, and she immediately covered her
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can we do anything for her?” asked
Lucy; and Lucy’s manner was very sweet
when she chose. Pecy had never happened
to hear her voice sound like this; and something—perhaps
it was surprise—caused
her to shake with convulsive sobs.</p>

<p>“I dun know,” replied the woman, stirring
vigorously with the spoon. “I’m mixing
mandrake and ’lasses. I <i>’lowed</i> she’d
get wet goin’ to the pastur’ in the rain; but
she won’t mind <i>me</i>, sevin’ (excepting) I licks
her.”</p>

<p>“What a home, and what a mother!”
thought the campers.</p>

<p>“Would you like to have us bring her
some lemons and sugar?” asked Preston.</p>

<p>There was a quick stirring of the bundle
of rags on the floor, and Pecy’s rough head
and flushed face appeared for a moment
above the surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“We are all sorry you are sick, Pecy,”
continued Preston; “we didn’t know those
hailstones were coming, or we would have
kept you at our house.” This was as near
a confession as he chose to make; and,
closing the subject, “Now we’ll go back and
get the lemons and sugar. Good-by, Pecy.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever in all your life!” exclaimed
Sadie, when they were safely in the boat
again. Words seemed utterly powerless to
express the astonishment, pity, and disgust
of the whole party. “I’m so glad you
thought of the lemons, Preston,” said Lucy.</p>

<p>For there was an unspoken feeling with
her and all the rest, of responsibility for the
little creature they had thoughtlessly ill-treated.
Was there anything more they
could do for her? They “wondered she
didn’t die and done with it in such a home.
Perhaps her mother would kill her with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
doses.” Yes; but who had driven her out
without mercy into the storm? If she <i>should</i>
die, would Camp Comfort be free from
blame?</p>

<p>They hastened back with ten lemons,—all
they had of yesterday’s purchase,—and their
entire stock of sugar and flour. Not a word
of thanks did they receive or expect; but
the look of joy on Pecy’s dusky face was
reward enough.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>she’s</i> all right,” said Preston. “A little
sore throat, that’s all. And tar won’t
hurt her, or mandrake either.—There, now,
spread your parasols, for the sun’s coming
out. Shall we row up stream or down?”</p>

<p>The next Saturday evening Mary Gray was
sitting at her mother’s feet, looking wistfully
in her face. She had come home to stay over
Sunday, and had just been repeating in a
sweet, clear voice, and with unusual feeling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the “verse” she was to speak at Sabbath
School concert:—</p>

<p>“I think that is just lovely, mamma. Only
it doesn’t seem somehow as if He could,
you know! Not <i>the worst of girls!</i>” Then
interrupting herself,—“Mamma, are there
any heathen in America?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my daughter, I fear there are. But
why do you ask? You can never have seen
any?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mamma, I have seen them. They
live at Old Bluff. Their name is Pancake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
They don’t belong anywhere, and they haven’t
been there long. Preston says Queen Victoria
ought to take care of them, but I suppose
she hasn’t heard of them yet, and they
are growing up heathen. Why, mamma,
they can’t read, and don’t go to church; they
fish Sundays, and dig worms and shoot
ducks.”</p>

<p>And Mary went on with a graphic story of
Pecy, one of “the worst of girls,” and the
bother they had had with her at Camp Comfort.
When it came to the adventure in the hailstorm,
Mrs. Gray looked pained.</p>

<p>“I knew you wouldn’t like it, mamma,
when they clapped her out. She got sick,
too, and we all went to see her, and carried
lemons and sugar, and she was well in a day
or two. But, oh, such a house, and such a
mother! Preston says she thinks the earth
stands still, and the sun moves round it!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Her husband knows more; but what I was
going to ask you is,—Well, you remember
those Chinese babies——”</p>

<p>Mary found it difficult to proceed.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, I remember.”</p>

<p>“You said I wanted to please Mrs. Lee,
and make her and the girls think I was generous.
That was true; I know I did, and it
has made me ashamed ever since,” said Mary,
a pink blush creeping over her forehead.</p>

<p>Her mother saw it, and wondered if anything
in all this naughty world is more innocent
than a child’s blush? She was sure
there is nothing half so fair.</p>

<p>“Well, dear, go on.”</p>

<p>“So I was thinking——Are these Pancake
heathen almost as bad as the Chinese,
mamma?”</p>

<p>“Yes, quite as bad, I should say.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, couldn’t I give them all my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
July pin-money, and not let anybody know it?
That would make up for the Chinese babies;
and I know I should feel better.”</p>

<p>“Are you in sober earnest, Mary?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mamma, I’ve thought and thought
about it. I’m in real earnest this time, and
I don’t want to be ‘<i>seen of men</i>.’ Do you
understand, mamma?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, I understand. But you wanted
new gloves and new music.”</p>

<p>“I know it, but I don’t care. I can wait.
I’ve thought it all over, and I shan’t be sorry
this time. Are you willing?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly willing.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray considered a moment. “I will
consult with Mr. Lee or Miss Pike about this
family. They are both very wise in such
matters; and if they approve you <i>shall</i> give
something to the little girl. And I promise
you, Mary, nobody shall know who gives it.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>MISS PIKE’S STORY.</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Papa</span>, we are starving. Do send us a
watermelon!” wrote Mary one day, and
sent home the note by little Kittyleen, whose
visit was at last over.</p>

<p>Dr. Gray laughed again and again at this
pathetic appeal, and chancing to see Mrs.
Townsend picking strawberries in her garden,
he paused as he went by to tell her how
the children were suffering.</p>

<p>“They had plenty day before yesterday,”
said she, laughing in her turn. “O doctor,
have you ever been out to their camp? They
are the most disorderly, wasteful creatures:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
and just think of the grocer’s bills they are
running up.”</p>

<p>“It’s an extravagant piece of business,”
assented the doctor; “but they are having a
delightful time, something to remember all
their lives. It won’t last more than two or
three weeks at farthest, and I for one shan’t
mind the bills if the little souls don’t starve
and are happy.”</p>

<p>“You are just like the general,” returned
Mrs. Townsend, with a disapproving smile;
and then went into the house to make with
her own hands a strawberry short-cake for
Miss Pike and Julia Gray to take to Camp
Comfort in the sunshade carriage with the
other goodies.</p>

<p>It was quite the fashion for the parents,
aunts, cousins, and other friends to make
little donation visits to the quintette, who
always hailed both visitors and viands with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
joy. But to-day the “favorite friend,” Miss
Pike, sister Julia, and the watermelon, coming
all together, were almost too much for
Mary.</p>

<p>Miss Pike was the most entertaining of
guests, and had brought a story with her,
written expressly for the Quintette Club—so
she informed them as they all gathered
about her in a delighted group after dinner.</p>

<p>“Oh let’s have it now, this moment. Oh,
Miss Pike, you are a darling.”</p>

<p>“Well, you may bring my hand-bag, Mary.
And will Julia read aloud while I sew? For
I’m rather hurried, you see.”</p>

<p>She had already been over to Old Bluff,
measured Pecy Pancake with her eye, and
found she was about Fanny’s size; and now
the dear soul began to baste a calico frock for
the machine, while Julia read.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Family Mystery</span>,<br />

<i>Revealed by a Chimney.</i></h3>

<p>Here I am, at my last gasp. I’ve stood it
thirty-five years without flinching, but now
my time is come. Pleasant sky, you and I
must part. Bright sun, good by. Remember
I am but a “humble instrument,” and forgive
me for smoking in your face. Look, iron-hearted
men,—see how a hero dies! For
I’m dying in a good cause, and it’s not I
that will cry “Quarter.”</p>

<p>Well, what would you do? Here I am
alone,—shovel, tongs, cooking-stove, all
gone, that made life desirable! Yesterday,
sir, you climbed atop of the house, tore off
the tin roof, and rolled it up into parcels like
so much jelly-cake. I looked on and saw
you, but the bitterness was past. The time
I could have wept was the day my family had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
notice to leave. Now they are gone, and
what care I what happens? I saw you pull
down the walls, till the air was so thick with
plaster you could almost cut it with a knife.
I saw you rip up the chamber-floor as if it
had been a rag carpet. I saw you pull away
the door-steps, where <i>she</i> used to stand,
looking up and down the street.</p>

<p>I saw women and children coming to carry
away shingles and clapboards for kindlings.
Little by little, crash by crash, down went
the house, till there was nothing left standing
but the other chimney and me—and
this morning <i>he</i> was taken. Now I’m sole
survivor. I’m red as far down as the chamber
fireplace; the rest of the way I’m white.
Some of you laughed, seeing me standing
up alone, with a white body and red head,
and said I looked “like a monument smiling
at grief.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, yes, and my grief began to come
(or rather I began to come to grief) last
winter, when I first heard my family say the
“city fathers” were going to “improve the
street.” As we were a frame house, one
story with basement kitchen, I feared, and
my family feared, our room would be considered
better than our company.</p>

<p>“And if they do pull the house down, where
shall <i>we</i> go?” asked poor Mr. Dean, as they
all sat about the sitting-room fireplace. He
was always asking his wife “what they should
do,” and she a sick woman, coughing there in
her chair! But Mr. Dean has been a broken-down
man ever since that affair of Dick’s,
which I am about to relate.</p>

<p>There are three Dean children, John,
Dick, and Nell. <i>She</i>—I mean Nell—has a
voice like a harp, and I’ve heard it remarked
that her hair is a trap to catch a sunbeam.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Bless her, I always did my best to draw when
<i>she</i> laid the coal on the grate! Her father
never could understand why she had so
much better luck than he had in making a
fire!</p>

<p>John, the oldest, is married, and living in
Boston. He has always paid his father’s rent,
and the Deans have lived here ever since
Dick was born. I <i>think</i> they had a life-lease.
They could afford to laugh at their neighbors
on moving day. Who’ll laugh now? I’m
getting wheezy—thank you, little boy—put
on more shingles, it warms my heart.</p>

<p>Where was I? O, speaking of the trouble.
It is the family mystery, twelve months old;
and the odd part of it is, that I know more
about it than anyone else in the family.</p>

<p>A year ago, when Dick was attending the
academy, he came home one night with a
diamond ring on his forefinger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“How splendid! Whose is it?” said Nell,
who was making buttered toast for supper.</p>

<p>“That’s telling,” says Dick. “What if
it’s my own?”</p>

<p>“Then it’s paste.”</p>

<p>“Paste, ma’am? It’s a <i>solitaire</i>, worth
seven hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>Nell let the toast burn. She put the ring
on her finger and turned it round and round.
Knowing it was worth seven hundred dollars,
and its owner wouldn’t take a thousand, she
saw at once it was an elegant affair. After
Dick had teased her a while, he told her it
belonged to James Van Duster, the wealthiest
boy in school.</p>

<p>“And he doesn’t know I’ve got it. I
slipped it off his finger while I was helping
him out with his Greek. Won’t it be a good
joke to see his long face to-morrow morning?”</p>

<p>“O Dick, how dared you?” said Nell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>And then I smelt the toast burning again,
and heard her scraping it with a knife.</p>

<p>“The ring is too large for you, Dick. Let
me take it for safe keeping.”</p>

<p>“You, Miss Nell! Why, you’d serve it up
in the toast-dip, just as you did the saltspoon
last week.”</p>

<p>“But think, Dick, if anything should
happen to such a splendid jewel!”</p>

<p>“There isn’t anything going to happen!
Don’t fret! If I was in the habit of losing
things now——”</p>

<p>Dick checked himself, and I suspect he
blushed. Nell, with all her kindness of heart,
couldn’t help laughing, for Dick was as
harum-scarum as a hurricane.</p>

<p>I felt low-spirited from that moment, and
knew I shouldn’t breathe freely till the
precious ring was fairly out of the house.</p>

<p>In the evening Dick came down into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
basement kitchen again to crack some butternuts.
He knelt by the brick hearth and began
to pound. I could have told him better than
that. There was a crack in a corner of the
fireplace, and all of a sudden off slipped that
ring and rolled into it. <i>Of course!</i></p>

<p>You could have knocked me over with a
feather. But, as true as I stand here, that
boy went whistling upstairs, and never missed
the ring till Nell asked what he had done
with it.</p>

<p>You may depend there were a few remarks
made then. Dick rushed upstairs and down,
and the whole family went to hunting. Next
morning a carpenter was sent for to take up
the boards under the dining-room table.
There was a hole in the carpet there, and
Dick was almost sure he must have dropped
the ring when he stooped to pick up his
knife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>How I longed to be heard! I talked then
as plainly as I do now, but they thought it
was the wind “sighing down chimney.”</p>

<p>Nell suggested that the ring might be
around the fireplace.</p>

<p>“You’re warm, my dear,” whispered I, as
they say in games when you come near a
right guess.</p>

<p>But, alas, they didn’t look deep enough;
there was a crack in the mortar under the
bricks, and there lies that ring now, at the
north-east corner, eight inches from the surface;
there it lies to this day!</p>

<p>Well, what’s a diamond ring? Nothing
but the dust of the earth; no better than
Lehigh coal anyway. But James Van Duster
didn’t think so. And the worst is to tell.
He wasn’t quite so absent-minded as our
Dick took him to be; <i>he</i> knew when the
ring was drawn off his finger as well as either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
you or I would have known. And being a
high-spirited young fellow, with a narrow
mind, and envious of our Dick besides, what
should he do that morning but send an officer
after Dick. You could have heard Mr. Dean
groan across the street. The officer was very
polite, and listened respectfully to all the
family had to say; but I’ve no means of
knowing whether he believed it or not. All
I can state with certainty is that old Mr. Van
Duster interfered, and said if Dick could pay
James the price of the ring, the matter should
be hushed up, and he needn’t go to jail.</p>

<p>Seven hundred dollars! Why, old Mr.
Dean just earned his salt by tending an
oven at a bakery! There was nothing in
the house of any value but Mrs. Dean’s
piano, and that wouldn’t bring more than
three hundred dollars. Of course it went,
though—poor Nelly, how that took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
life out of her!—and John made up the
rest of the money in the shape of a loan.
I did think John was hard-faced, wife or no
wife. He might have <i>given</i> Dick the money
for their mother’s sake. It was too bad for
such a young fellow as Dick to be saddled
with a debt.</p>

<p>After this he couldn’t afford his time to
go to school; so he got a clerkship. He
tried to hold up his head with the best of
them till he began to see his mates turning
the cold shoulder. The Van Dusters hadn’t
kept their word. You see, the story had
been whispered around that Dick stole a
solitaire and sold it to a Jew who had run
off with it, and <i>that</i> was why James Van
Duster was obliged to stoop to wear a cluster
diamond. This was more than Dick
could bear. He ran away, and went to
work on a farm in New Jersey. He kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
writing home that his mother’s letters were
his greatest comfort. She had perfect faith
that the mystery would be cleared up some
time, but I think hope deferred was the
cause of her illness.</p>

<p>The old gentleman gave up at once, and
everything fell upon Nell. She found some
employment, embroidering and copying and
the like of that, and had most of the housework
to do besides. I never knew such a
girl. All the amusement she seemed to
have was going to the door, standing on the
steps, and looking up and down the street.</p>

<p>(More shingles, boys, I’m about out of
breath.)</p>

<p>Ah, well, we’ve been a suffering family;
but we have our blessings after all; not the
least of which is Nell. We have had some
cosy times this winter, too, popping corn
over the open fire; but it’s all past now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
The family went to Thirty-fifth Street yesterday.
I don’t know how I could have
borne it, but I’m sustained by this reflection;
I am dying; dying, too, for the good
of the family.</p>

<p>Yes, when <i>I</i> fall the ring will be revealed!
To whom? Aye, there’s the rub! Not to
you noisy, rollicking boys, I hope and trust!
I keep looking out for Nell. I heard her
tell her mother day before yesterday “she
should watch that kitchen chimney when it
went.”</p>

<p>Bravo! There she stands! That’s Nell!
That modest girl in the blue dress, with the
bird on her hat. Bravo, Nell! I’m reeling,
dear. I’ve got my death-blow, I’ve only
been waiting for you!</p>

<p>Hammer away, ye iron-hearted men!
Make an end of me now. I’m dying in a
good cause, sirs, in a good cause, <i>yes!</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Farewell, sweet Nell, <i>North-East corner;
eight inches down!</i> Farewell, N-e-l-l!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Allow me to add that our friend, the late
Chimney, did not die with a lie in his mouth.
There <i>was</i> a ring. Nell found it.</p>

<p>Imagine the delight of the Dean family!
The newspapers made it appear that the
Honorable Van Duster was very magnanimous,
for he gave Dick the price of the
ring—seven hundred dollars. Why not,
indeed? Hadn’t Mr. Van Duster received
payment in full? But he also gave back the
boy’s good name, which was worth a thousand
diamond rings.</p>

<p>“But he can’t make up to my Dick for the
two dreadful years he has borne. That suffering
can <i>never</i> be made up,” said old Mr.
Dean, shaking the ashes out of his pipe.</p>

<p>I can’t agree with him. Hasn’t the suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
been made up to Dick in patience
and thoughtfulness and charity for others?
If you knew him you would think so, I know.
It was a hard experience; but Dick is wondrously
improved. He is the staff of the
family now, and his loving mother says:—</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>DINING OUT.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Miss Pike</span> had “a kind of a <i>way</i> with
her,” as Mary expressed it, which was charming
alike to old and young and rich and poor.
In the three days she spent at Camp Comfort
she won the hearts of the Pecks, who
lived half a mile at the left; also the hearts
of the Browns, who lived half a mile at the
right. And across the river, in that benighted
red cottage, her presence was felt
like a full beam of sunshine.</p>

<p>She was interested at once in poor,
wretched, overworked little Pecielena, who,
she saw, was far superior to her vagabond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
brothers and sisters. She told the Quintette
she would like to become better acquainted
with the child, and suggested asking her
over to the camp to dinner. Pecielena had
never even knocked at their door since the
night of the hailstorm; but Mary espied her
at a distance with her milk-pail, and ran up
to her, saying, with beaming good will,—</p>

<p>“Pecy, we’ll let you come to our house to
dinner to-morrow if you want to!”</p>

<p>Some people might not have considered
this a very cordial invitation, but Pecy was
more than satisfied with it, and, as her
mother had been won by Miss Pike, there
was no objection made to her going.</p>

<p>“What, eat dinner at <i>that</i> house! Would
the girls let her sit down with them at the
table?” she wondered, feeling as if a star
had dropped at her feet.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dr. and Mrs. Gray had arrived,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
their carriage fairly loaded with eatables, a
huge plum pudding riding between them, to
make room for which little Ethel had to be
perched at their feet on a cricket. It was
Dr. Gray’s first vacation, and he would have
preferred a day at the seaside; but when
he heard that the Quintette would “break
camp” in another week, he decided to visit
Old Bluff and make Mary happy.</p>

<p>“How good you are, papa, and how I love
you!” said she, springing into his arms,
while the girls rolled the dainties out of the
carriage like peas out of a pod.</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma!” said she, when she had
her mother to herself at last in her own
hammock, “we are going to have that heathen
I told you of to dinner. And I haven’t
said one word to Miss Pike about my giving
her my pin-money, not one word. There are
three poor families,—Jack calls them a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
‘peck of brown pancakes;’ he means the
Pecks, and Browns, and Pancakes, you know.
And the girls want to do something for all
of them, and I suppose they think I’m cold-hearted
and stingy.”</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t like them to think that,
do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do, mamma; it’s no more than
fair,” said Mary stoutly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray had never in her life felt so well
pleased with her young daughter as at this
moment. It was very clear now that Mary
had been honestly disgusted with her own
conduct, and had chosen this way to punish
herself for her false charity and love of
display.</p>

<p>“And I’ll not spoil it all by praising
her,” thought the discreet mother.</p>

<p>When she went into the house with Mary
the girls began to talk about Pecielena. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
were rather “in fancy” with her since Miss
Pike had taken her up.</p>

<p>“You don’t know how she has improved,
auntie, since we came here,” said Lucy.
“She used to be saucy; but somehow she’s
afraid of us now, and we never see her unless
we meet her, or go where she is.”</p>

<p>“And she doesn’t look the same in the
new calico dress, does she, Miss Pike?” said
Sadie. “She isn’t handsome, but she has
soft, graceful ways like a kitten, and like a
swan, and like a gazelle; and you ought to
see her row a boat! If mother’s willing, I’m
going to give her my dark green ladies-cloth
dress to make over.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to show her how to bang her
hair,” said Fanny. “And I have a Kate
Greenaway dress she may have.”</p>

<p>This, with a side-glance at Mary. “I’d
as lief let her have my handbag as not,”
remarked Blanche Jones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“Shan’t <i>you</i> do anything, Flaxie? You
have so much money of your own.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray could scarcely restrain an
amused smile as Mary replied in a low voice,</p>

<p>“Perhaps I’ll do something—I’ll see”—and
then had to steal out of the room for
fear she might add,—</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed I’m going to do more than
all the rest of you put together. And if
mamma’s willing, I shall teach Pecy her
letters too!”</p>

<p>The young lady under discussion was now
seen approaching the house.</p>

<p>“Why, this can’t be the little savage
you’ve said so much about,” exclaimed Mrs.
Gray, looking out of the rainbow-window.
“But what a thin, old looking face!”</p>

<p>Pecy was in holiday attire. Miss Pike’s
calico dress fitted her well, and it seems she
did possess a pair of whole shoes, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
borrowed her mother’s pink sun-bonnet.
To say she was modest and well-behaved
would be incorrect; but Mrs. Gray did not
find her as bold and impudent as had been at
first represented.</p>

<p>Though twelve years old, she had never
dined at a really civilized table; so now, when
she found herself seated before an array of
brown linen tablecloth, clean dishes, and
tolerably bright silver, she was obviously
quite bewildered. In her eyes, Dr. Gray was
a wonderful man, while his wife and daughters
were no less than queen and princesses.
As for Miss Pike, she would probably have
classed her among angels, if she had ever
heard of such beings, which is hardly likely.</p>

<p>She could not manage a fork, and in attempting
it, often dropped her food upon the
tablecloth. But it was worst of all when
the pie was served. Lucy, annoyed by her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
shocking manners, refrained from looking at
her, as she said with cool politeness,—</p>

<p>“Pecielena, will you have a piece of pie?”</p>

<p>Now Miss Pancake, painfully aware of her
awkwardness, was resolved for once to show
her quickness and dexterity. Never stopping
to see that Lucy was about to put the pie into
a little plate, she held out her <i>hand</i> for a
piece! You can hardly believe it, but that
was the fashion at home. She <i>always</i> held
out her hand when she wanted a piece of pie,
and her mother flung it into her outstretched
palm. How should she know that this was
not the custom that prevailed in polite
society? But when Lucy passed her a little
plate with freezing dignity, she understood
her mistake in a moment. She saw, too, that
Mary and Fanny were exchanging glances of
surprise and amusement. They would have
laughed aloud if they had dared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>All this was too much for poor little Pecy,
who had tried to behave so well. She sprang
up suddenly, overturned her chair, and, never
stopping for her pink sun-bonnet, ran for dear
life out of the house. She did not cease
running till she reached the bank; and then
she sat down upon some stones and cried. It
was an immense relief to get away from such
overstrained gentility. Pie in little plates
indeed! As if her own hand were not clean
enough to hold a piece of pie!</p>

<p>She looked up at dear Old Bluff, and
thought what a grand thing it is to be a
mountain and not be expected to know anything
about the fashions. She was sure she
should never wish to see anything more of
polite society.</p>

<p>But here was the strangest part of it; she
had a secret longing for this very thing!
She had already begun to wash her face every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
day, and, as far as possible, to comb her
tangled hair. She was ashamed of her uncouth
language, which she now perceived was
quite unlike that of the young people at
Camp Comfort. Oh, if she could talk like
them! If she could read, as they did, out of
books! Above all, if she only knew how to
“behave!” There was a skill in carrying a fork
to one’s mouth with food on it, that passed
her comprehension. How could people do
it? It seemed vastly harder to her than
walking a tight-rope, which she had seen
done at a circus!</p>

<p>Oh dear, to think they had invited her to a
grand dinner, and she couldn’t “behave,” and
they had laughed at her! There was something
<i>in</i> this little girl, or she would not have
been capable of so much shame. She had
naturally a shrewd, bright mind, which, of
course, had been running to waste. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
seen cities and villages whizzing by her from
car-windows in travelling, but her little life
had all been spent in backwoods places, and
Camp Comfort was really almost her first near
view of civilized life. Now she was waking to
a new world. If she could only get to it, if
she could only live in it! She had as many
eyes, ears, and fingers as anybody else: Why
couldn’t she be a nice, proper, polite little
girl,—say, for instance, like that pretty
Flaxie Frizzle, who had treated her so kindly
and offered to take her with her to church?</p>

<p>Flaxie’s mother was so nice! Perhaps she
had cows, and needed a little girl to milk
them? But, oh dear, she wouldn’t hire anybody
that couldn’t “behave!”</p>

<p>After this, Pecielena hovered about Camp
Comfort longingly, but would have got no
farther than the door-stone, if Flaxie had not
come out and urged her to enter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh yes, come in, Pecy, come in, and have
some raisins.”</p>

<p>It had been a bright day for Pecy when the
Quintette came to Camp Comfort, a brighter
day than she knew. Miss Pike had a “plan”
for her. She meant to win the child away
from her “queer” father and all her miserable
surroundings, and have her reared carefully
in a good Christian family. But Miss
Pike did not speak of this at present. She
never talked much about her plans till they
were well matured.</p>

<p>Pecielena nearly cried her eyes out on the
day the Quintette “broke camp.” They
were obliged to go, for the Hunnicuts of
Rosewood wanted the house. There was a
farewell dirge on the cornet and harmonica,
a touching farewell to Old Bluff and the
River Dee, the big barn, the front door-yard,
the white rose-bush, the spreading elms, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
“broad-breasted old oak tree” in the corner;
and the Quintette and the Trio retired again
to private life.</p>

<p>“Pecy,” said Mary, as the little waif stood
at the gate with her milk pail, looking mournfully
at the grass, “Pecy, my mamma said I
might ask you to go to my house at Laurel
Grove. Would you like to go?”</p>

<p>“O may I?” almost screamed Pecy. “But
I hain’t got no gown and bunnit to wear.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think about your clothes, dear;
you look well enough; and when you get to
my house, I’ll make you have a good time;
now see if I don’t.”</p>

<p>Thus Pecy’s tears were happily dried. In
a few weeks the “camping out” had become
“old times;” a dear and fragrant memory,
which the young people loved to recall. It
had been a delight to the whole eight while
it lasted; but what it had been to the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
families about Old Bluff,—the Pecks, Browns,
and Pancakes,—who shall say?</p>

<p>And one day it occurred to busy Miss Pike
that she hadn’t quite enough to do, for she
was only teaching school, studying French
and German, and getting up Christmas festivals
for Laurel Grove and Rosewood children;
but she must try to manage a Christmas
Tree for the little outcasts of Old Bluff.
There would be no leisure for it on Christmas
Eve, the twenty fourth; neither on the twenty-fifth;
but the twenty-sixth would answer
every purpose.</p>

<p>And where could the tree be put? Where
else but in the parlor of Camp Comfort itself?
The Hunnicuts were willing at once. They
had but one child, James, and he was ready
to help. So were the Quintette and the Trio
of course, and so were all their relatives and
friends.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>CHRISTMAS AT OLD BLUFF.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the handsomest evergreens in the
Townsend woods was chopped off close by
the roots, and dragged to Camp Comfort by
Preston Gray and James Hunnicut. The
Old Bluff children had thought and dreamed
of nothing else for three weeks but that
mysterious Christmas Tree. If it were to
be placed in a church they would have
shrunk from approaching it, for they were
afraid of churches, and none of the Pancakes,
except Pecielena, and none of the
Pecks, except Charlie, had as yet been drawn
inside a Sunday school. Or if the Tree were
to be in some elegant house at Laurel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Grove, in a cold parlor with high walls and
solemn marble fireplaces, where rich children
congregate, what would these little
savages have cared for it then?</p>

<p>But this Tree, <i>their</i> Tree, was to be at
Camp Comfort, a place they knew all about;
and the doorkeeper, Mr. Hunnicut, was to
let in every child big enough to walk. As
for the grown people, they would be let in
also, but merely that they might take care
of the children; for that is all that is wanted
of grown people at Christmas time!</p>

<p>Mary Gray, Ethel, Blanche Jones, and
Fanny Townsend watched the clouds for
the whole three weeks. At one time it
rained, and there were fears of “a green
Christmas;” then it grew cold, and the first
snow came; but before there was much
time to be glad of the snow, the wind hastened
along and heaped it into drifts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“It isn’t likely they’ll have a Tree if it
keeps on drifting like this,” said Dora, who
was apt to grow melancholy when she baked
for “two days running;” and surely the
turkeys, pies, puddings, and cakes that had
gone through her hands were enough to
drag her spirits very low. Mary did not
know then of her own new piano that was
to be given her on Christmas, and Dora’s
prediction seemed to spoil all her holiday
joy; but her father reassured her.</p>

<p>“Why, my child, we’ll have the Tree if
the drifts are as high as your head.”</p>

<p>Ethel said there were to be “three Christmases
this year; one at Laurel Grove, one
at Rosewood, and one at Old Bluff.” Yes,
and the wind held its breath, and the sun
and moon shone for every one of the three!</p>

<p>When the night came for “Old Bluff
Christmas,” a rose-blue sky bent above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
white splendor of the world. The Pecks,
Browns, and Pancakes arrived in wild haste
at Camp Comfort before Mr. Hunnicut was
ready to let them in. They would have
thought him very unfeeling if they had
known that he was finishing his turkey supper
while they waited in the entry.</p>

<p>But they did not wait long. There was a
loud jingling of sleigh-bells, the blowing of
a cornet, and the eight campers and lame
Sadie Stockwell appeared in a boat-sleigh
drawn by two horses adorned with about
twenty strings of bells. Behind this imposing
equipage glided the modest sleighs containing
meek parents and friends.</p>

<p>Then the warm, cheerful parlor was thrown
open at last, with its dozen lamps, blazing
and twinkling as if they knew it was
Christmas; and the beautiful tree was
seen shining like all the stars in the sky.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Aloft, on the topmost part, stood a little
waxen image called the Christ-child; and if
it had been alive it could hardly have smiled
more benignly.</p>

<p>Dr. Gray, stepping forward, told the
delighted little guests to look up at it and
think of it as the image of the little child
Jesus, the good Lord, who loved little children
while on earth, and who loves them still
in heaven.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Lee made a short prayer, so very
simple that the youngest ones could understand;
but they scarcely listened for looking
at the Tree.</p>

<p>Ah, you that have seen Trees ever since
you can remember, they are an old story to
you; but if you were a poor little child, and
this were your first vision of one, can you
fancy what it would be to you then?</p>

<p>Pecielena Pancake, with hair neatly braided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and falling down the back of her new frock,
stood gazing at it in amazement. To her it
was a beautiful marvel. Her mother would
not come, but had sent all the children, and
they were dragging and tugging at her skirts.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peck and Mrs. Brown were there,
women who could not “behave” much better
than Pecy, but they were quiet and smiling,
and they and all the poor rough little children
stood looking at the shining Tree with
lips far apart and very wide eyes.</p>

<p>Some of the children were trembling between
smiles and tears, so eagerly hoping
they had presents coming, so sadly afraid they
hadn’t!</p>

<p>The Quintette and the Trio looked around
benevolently. Mary Gray felt little thrills of
joy at seeing the children so happy now, and
knowing they would be happier still when the
presents were given out. She was glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Sadie Stockwell was there and enjoying it;
but it had not occurred to her to be proud because
she herself was the one who had thought
of inviting Sadie. Neither was Mary conscious
this evening of her own looks and
appearance. Her tresses “of crisped gold”
floated unheeded, and she never once looked
down at her new dress to admire the color.
Her thoughts were not of herself but of
others.</p>

<p>“Dr. Gray,” said Miss Pike in a low tone,
“don’t you agree with me that this last year
has been the best year of Mary’s life? I believe
she will grow up to be a thoughtful,
unselfish woman.”</p>

<p>“<i>Flaxie Growing Up!</i>” said Dr. Gray,
blinking and rubbing his eyes.</p>

<p>“Why, Doctor, she is thirteen,” laughed
Miss Pike. “But, there, they are beginning
to sing, and we must go over and join them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>After the Christmas songs, Dr. Gray and
General Townsend took off the presents.</p>

<p>There was a joyous scream from Pecy
Pancake when she received her new cloak of
gray beaver cloth, with buttons to match, and
a collar that would turn down or up. The
name of the giver was not mentioned, and
the studied look of innocence on Mary’s face
was edifying to behold.</p>

<p>Preston’s expression was equally innocent
when Charlie Peck bounded forward and
seized his brave sled, “Clipper,” and when
little Bobby Brown shouted over his first pair
of skates.</p>

<p>And every time a present was taken off the
Tree, the little candles on the branches seemed
to twinkle more gayly, and the Christ-child
to smile more benevolently than ever.</p>

<p>“Susy Peck,” called Dr. Gray from the
right, and a wee girl stepped forward with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
fingers in her mouth, and snatched—snatched
is the word—the pretty doll which Julia
Gray had dressed in a scarlet frock, with
fashionable hood, fur tippet, and muff. Like
most of the others, Susy forgot to say
“Thank you;” but I suppose it was the
proudest moment of her life.</p>

<p>“Baby Peck,” called out General Townsend
from the left; and another wee girl toddled
up, holding on by her mother’s finger, and
got a handsome box so full of sugarplums
that the cover would hardly stay on. And
then the overjoyed baby had to be taken in
her mother’s arm, lest, in running about to
show the box, she should get under everybody’s
feet.</p>

<p>“Johnny Brown,” called Dr. Gray. And
Johnny’s chin dropped on his little ragged
necktie with delight at receiving a pretty
jacket with linen collar and cuffs, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
“Electric Light” was suddenly extinguished
behind the parlor door.</p>

<p>But why enumerate the presents which fell
like ripe fruit from that bountiful Tree? The
pretty dresses, the modest needle-books, the
painted drums, beautiful books and pictures,
and all manner of gay toys?</p>

<p>And why describe the long table which the
ladies had spread with every dainty that these
children had ever sighed for; real turkey
with genuine “stuffing;” cakes of all sorts
and sizes, with fruit and without; some as
yellow as gold, and some buried under snow-drifts
of frosting; and best of all, perhaps, to
them, large mounds of candy, oranges, nuts,
and raisins!</p>

<p>“Worth while, isn’t it?” said the “Electric
Light,” nodding his head, which was nearly as
bright as a Christmas candle.</p>

<p>“Our coming out to Camp Comfort was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
great thing for the neighbors,” remarked Bert
Abbott to James Hunnicut, who wished <i>he</i>
had been one of the immortal three!</p>

<p>And Preston took off his spectacles and
wiped them, remarking that the glass was
apt to grow dim in a warm room.</p>

<p>“Now strike up your cornet, Jack; take
your harmonica, Sadie, and let’s have another
Christmas song.”</p>

<p>The poor, little, happy, wondering children
listened in delight, as the music seemed to
hover and float on wings over the heads of the
people, losing itself at last in the upper air.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>And, all the while, the beautiful Christmas
Tree stood glittering with its little candles,
its green branches stripped of everything but
their straight pine needles.</p>

<p>Miss Pike looked up from the children’s
happy faces to the Christmas Tree, and her
soul was stirred with awe. For the Christ-child
on the topmost bough seemed alive;
and behold how large he grew, how grand
and beautiful! It was as if the heaven of
heavens could not contain him: yet he was
there in that very room, and she beheld him!
His arms were extended in blessing, his lips
moved, and in a still, small voice, as if it fell
from the sky, she heard him say once more:
“<i>Suffer little children to come unto me, and
forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of
heaven.</i>”</p>

steel and tinder were used to light fires; when soda and saleratus had
